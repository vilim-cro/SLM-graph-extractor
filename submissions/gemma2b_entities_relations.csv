Set in the Dakota Territory, 1889, the story describes the arrest, trial, and conviction of Jim Trusdale, a simple-minded rancher's son, for a crime he may not have committed.

"Datolite is a calcium boron hydroxide nesosilicate, CaBSiO4(OH). It was first observed by Jens Esmark in 1806, and named by him from δατεῖσθαι, ""to divide,"" and λίθος, ""stone,"" in allusion to the granular structure
of the massive mineral.

Datolite crystallizes in the monoclinic system forming prismatic crystals and nodular masses. The luster is vitreous and may be brown, yellow, light green or colorless. The Mohs hardness is 5.5 and the specific gravity is 2.8 - 3.0. 

The type localities are in the diabases of the Connecticut River valley and Arendal, Aust-Agder, Norway. Associated minerals include prehnite, danburite, babingtonite, epidote, native copper, calcite, quartz and zeolites. It is common in the copper deposits of the Lake Superior region of Michigan. It occurs as a secondary mineral in mafic igneous rocks often filling vesicles along with zeolites in basalt. Unlike most localities throughout the world, the occurrence of datolite in the Lake Superior region is usually fine grained in texture and possesses colored banding. Much of the coloration is due to the inclusion of copper or associated minerals in progressive stages of hydrothermal precipitation.

On October 1, 2019, HLN announced it had greenlit a revival of the show, titled ""Forensic Files II"", which began airing on February 23, 2020. After long-time narrator Peter Thomas' death, the show has been narrated by Bill Camp.

"Arthur W. Perdue Stadium is a baseball stadium in Salisbury, Maryland. It is the home of the Baltimore Orioles Low-A East affiliate Delmarva Shorebirds. Named for the founder of Perdue Farms, Arthur Perdue, it features the Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame. The stadium seats 5,200 fans and opened in 1996.

As the second-largest seating venue in Salisbury, it also occasionally is used for concerts or other events. Until 2016, the larger Wicomico Youth and Civic Center had a real covenant against serving alcohol. As such, the stadium was chosen as the venue for Fernando Guerrero's middleweight title-winning boxing match in October 2009.

The University of Maryland Eastern Shore Hawks of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) played their 2018 and 2019 seasons at Perdue Stadium while Hawk Stadium in Princess Anne was renovated. Perdue Stadium hosted the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Baseball Tournament from 2015 to 2017.

In 1998, the stadium hosted the Delmarva Rockfish, a team in the single-season Maryland Fall Baseball league.","user

"The Caniapiscau River () is a tributary of the Koksoak River in Nunavik, Quebec, Canada. In Cree the name of the river means ""rocky point"".

Starting from Lac Sevestre ( south-west from Fermont) on the Canadian Shield, the Caniapiscau River flows northward through a wide, timbered glacial valley until it makes a sharp turn at its confluence with the Rivière aux Mélèzes (Larch River). At this point (called Kanniq Confluence), the river becomes the Koksoak River. The total length of the Caniapiscau River is .

Since 1985, the headwaters of the Caniapiscau River have been diverted into the La Grande hydroelectric complex. The headwaters of the Caniapiscau River, representing about 45% of the total flow, now drain into the La Grande River of James Bay.

"Romaine Brooks (born Beatrice Romaine Goddard; May 1, 1874 – December 7, 1970) was an American painter who worked mostly in Paris and Capri. She specialized in portraiture and used a subdued tonal palette keyed to the color gray. Brooks ignored contemporary artistic trends such as Cubism and Fauvism, drawing on her own original aesthetic inspired by the works of Charles Conder, Walter Sickert, and James McNeill Whistler. Her subjects ranged from anonymous models to titled aristocrats. She is best known for her images of women in androgynous or masculine dress, including her self-portrait of 1923, which is her most widely reproduced work.

Brooks had an unhappy childhood after her alcoholic father abandoned the family; her mother was emotionally abusive and her brother mentally ill. By her own account, her childhood cast a shadow over her whole life. She spent several years in Italy and France as a poor art student, then inherited a fortune upon her mother's death in 1902. Wealth gave her the freedom to choose her own subjects. She often painted people close to her, such as the Italian writer and politician Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Russian dancer Ida Rubinstein, and her partner of more than 50 years, the writer Natalie Barney.

Although she lived until 1970, it is erroneously believed that she painted very little after 1925; despite evidence to the contrary. She made a series of drawings during the 1930s, using an ""unpremeditated"" techniques predating automatic drawing. She spent time in New York City in the mid 1930s, completing portraits of Carl Van Vechten and Muriel Draper. Many of her works are unaccounted for, but photographic reproductions attest to her ongoing artwork. It is thought to have culminated in her 1961 portrait of Duke Uberto Strozzi.","user

"The Capitan Mountains are a mountain range in Lincoln County, in south-central New Mexico in the southwestern United States. The range is about 20 miles (32 km) long from east to west being about 6 miles (10 km) wide and were formed from a large elongated granite intrusion similar to the round one that produced Carrizo Mountain to the west.

The small town of Capitan is on the southwestern side of the mountain and is the location of Smokey Bear Historical Park. This is the park that memorializes the famous bear that was rescued from the Capitan Gap Fire in the Capitan Mountains. The highest point in the range is an unnamed peak reaching 10,201 feet (3139 m) which is 118 feet (36 m) higher than Capitan Peak. The entirety of the range lies within Lincoln National Forest and is separated from the Sacramento Mountains to the south and Sierra Blanca to the southwest by the valley of Rio Bonito.

"National Military Park, National Battlefield, National Battlefield Park, and National Battlefield Site are four designations for 25 battle sites preserved by the United States federal government because of their national importance. The designation applies to ""sites where historic battles were fought on American soil during the armed conflicts that shaped the growth and development of the United States...""

There are 11 National Battlefields, nine National Military Parks, four National Battlefield Parks, and one National Battlefield Site. The National Park Service does not distinguish among the four designations in terms of their preservation or management policies.

Seventeen sites are from the American Civil War, four from the American Revolutionary War, one from the War of 1812, one from the French and Indian War, and two were attacks on Native Americans.

In 1890, Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park was the first such site created by Congress. Originally these sites were maintained by the War Department, but were transferred to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. The different designations appear to represent Congressional attitudes at the time of authorization of each individual site, although ""park"" appears to be reserved for the larger sites. Only Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site, which is small, still bears that designation; others have since been redesignated.

"In control theory and stability theory, the Nyquist stability criterion or Strecker–Nyquist stability criterion, independently discovered by the German electrical engineer at Siemens in 1930 and the Swedish-American electrical engineer Harry Nyquist at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1932, is a graphical technique for determining the stability of a dynamical system. Because it only looks at the Nyquist plot of the open loop systems, it can be applied without explicitly computing the poles and zeros of either the closed-loop or open-loop system (although the number of each type of right-half-plane singularities must be known). As a result, it can be applied to systems defined by non-rational functions, such as systems with delays. In contrast to Bode plots, it can handle transfer functions with right half-plane singularities. In addition, there is a natural generalization to more complex systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, such as control systems for airplanes.

The Nyquist criterion is widely used in electronics and control system engineering, as well as other fields, for designing and analyzing systems with feedback. While Nyquist is one of the most general stability tests, it is still restricted to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Non-linear systems must use more complex stability criteria, such as Lyapunov or the circle criterion. While Nyquist is a graphical technique, it only provides a limited amount of intuition for why a system is stable or unstable, or how to modify an unstable system to be stable. Techniques like Bode plots, while less general, are sometimes a more useful design tool.","user

It is no longer spoken but remains the liturgical language of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, as well as their respective Eastern Catholic counterparts.

"Godzilla vs. Kong is a 2021 American monster film directed by Adam Wingard. A sequel to """" (2019) and """" (2017), it is the fourth film in Legendary's ""MonsterVerse"". It is also the 36th film in the ""Godzilla"" franchise, the twelfth film in the ""King Kong"" franchise, and the fourth ""Godzilla"" film to be completely produced by a Hollywood studio. The film stars Alexander Skarsgård, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Shun Oguri, Eiza González, Julian Dennison, Lance Reddick, Kyle Chandler, and Demián Bichir. In the film, Kong clashes with Godzilla as humans lure the ape into the Hollow Earth to retrieve a power source for a weapon to stop Godzilla's mysterious rampages.

The project was announced in October 2015 when Legendary declared plans for a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and King Kong. The film's writers room was assembled in March 2017, and Wingard was announced as the director in May 2017. Principal photography began in November 2018 in Hawaii, Australia and Hong Kong, and wrapped in April 2019.

After being delayed from a November 2020 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" was theatrically released internationally on March 24, 2021, and in the United States on March 31, where it was also released on HBO Max simultaneously. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the visual effects and action sequences, but criticism towards the script and human characters. It broke several pandemic box office records, and has grossed over $444 million worldwide, against a production budget between $155–200 million and a break-even point of $330 million, making it the third highest-grossing film of 2021.

It was proclaimed at the 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 7 April 2011, a few days before the 50th anniversary of the flight.

Yuri Gagarin crewed the Vostok 1 mission in 1961, completing one orbit around Earth over 108 minutes in the Vostok 3KA spacecraft, launched on a Vostok-K rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, USSR.

In the Soviet Union, 12 April was commemorated as Cosmonautics Day since 1963, and is still observed in Russia and some former Soviet states. Yuri's Night, also known as ""World Space Party"" is an international observance initiated in the United States in 2001, on the 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight.

Also commemorated on this date is the first Space Shuttle launch, STS-1 of ""Columbia"" on 12 April 1981, exactly 20 years after the first human spaceflight.","user

It was proclaimed at the 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 7 April 2011, a few days before the 50th anniversary of the flight.

Yuri Gagarin crewed the Vostok 1 mission in 1961, completing one orbit around Earth over 108 minutes in the Vostok 3KA spacecraft, launched on a Vostok-K rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, USSR.

In the Soviet Union, 12 April was commemorated as Cosmonautics Day since 1963, and is still observed in Russia and some former Soviet states. Yuri's Night, also known as ""World Space Party"" is an international observance initiated in the United States in 2001, on the 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight.

Also commemorated on this date is the first Space Shuttle launch, STS-1 of ""Columbia"" on 12 April 1981, exactly 20 years after the first human spaceflight.

The Wild Dog Destruction Board manages the Dingo Fence that runs along the New South Wales–Queensland and the New South Wales–South Australia borders. The New South Wales section of the Dingo Fence was originally built in 1921 with the purpose of preventing sheep predation by dingoes in Western New South Wales, it is estimated that without it sheep grazing would be uneconomical in the state west of Dubbo. Originally managed from Sydney, the management of the fence from the 1920s to the 1940s was considered ineffective, exacerbated by floods, droughts, inadequate funding and shortages of materials during the Second World War. The Wild Dog Destruction Board was founded in 1957 to rectify the management issues, it is headquartered in Broken Hill, a move that improved the organisation’s responsiveness compared to its managerial predecessor based in far away Sydney.

The game is the third entry in the ""Max Payne"" series and the sequel to ""Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne.""

The game is played from a third-person perspective. Throughout the single-player mode, players control Max Payne, a former NYPD detective. Nine years after the events of the second game, Max finds work as a private security contractor in São Paulo, Brazil, but becomes entangled in a quest filled with death and betrayal. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay in re-creations of multiple single-player settings.

As part of their research for the game's setting, the developers conducted field research around São Paulo throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. At release, ""Max Payne 3"" received highly positive reactions from critics, with praise particularly directed at its narrative, atmosphere, attention to detail and action, though some criticism was aimed at the change in style from its predecessors, its linear design, and depiction of São Paulo. ""Max Payne 3"" achieved high sales, shipping approximately three million units in the first week of release. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades from several gaming publications, winning a variety of them.","user

Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. At release, ""Max Payne 3"" received highly positive reactions from critics, with praise particularly directed at its narrative, atmosphere, attention to detail and action, though some criticism was aimed at the change in style from its predecessors, its linear design, and depiction of São Paulo. ""Max Payne 3"" achieved high sales, shipping approximately three million units in the first week of release. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades from several gaming publications, winning a variety of them.

"""I'm with Cupid"" is the fourteenth episode of ""The Simpsons"" tenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on Valentine's Day, 1999. The episode takes place on Valentine's Day, and the wives of Springfield are jealous of the attention Apu gives to his wife Manjula. Angered by this, Moe and the Springfield husbands spy on Apu to sabotage his romantic plans.

""I'm with Cupid"" was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Bob Anderson. Because the episode was to air on Valentine's Day, Fox wanted the episode to relate to the holiday, although the idea for the episode was pitched by Greaney. The title of the episode is based on the popular T-shirt slogan ""I'm with stupid"". Elton John guest-starred as himself, and recorded a new version of his song ""Your Song"" for the episode. The episode also features references to ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", Tiffany & Co. and ""Lisa the Vegetarian"", an earlier episode in the series.

In its original broadcast, ""I'm With Cupid"" was seen by approximately 7.7 million viewers and finished in 48th place in the ratings the week it aired.

Following the home media release of ""The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season"", the episode received generally positive reviews from critics.","user

The .270, .280, and .30-06 were all derived from the .30-03 parent case that came from the German 8x57 Mauser case which itself was based on the earlier 7x57 Mauser case. The .270 Winchester uses a .270 inch (6.86 mm) bore diameter and a .277 inch (7.04 mm) bullet diameter.

"Jackie Tyler is a fictional character played by Camille Coduri in the British science fiction television series ""Doctor Who"". The character, a resident of contemporary London, is introduced in the first episode of the 2005 revival as the mother of Rose Tyler, a travelling companion of the alien time traveller the Doctor. Jackie is a recurring character during the 2005 and 2006 series of the show, and later makes one-off appearances in 2008 and 2010. The character has also appeared in expanded universe material such as the ""Doctor Who"" New Series Adventures novels and the ""Doctor Who Magazine"" comic strip.

Within the series narrative, Jackie is a widow who lives alone with her daughter Rose until Rose leaves her mundane life behind to travel through time and space with the Doctor. Jackie's feeling of loss and of being left behind is explored in subsequent episodes. As the character is brought into danger by her proximity to the Doctor, she resents his influence over Rose. However, once he undergoes a regeneration, effectively becoming a new man, Jackie has a more cordial relationship with him. The character was written out at the end of the 2006 series, along with Rose, in a storyline which sees them trapped in a parallel universe where Jackie forms a new relationship with an alternate version of her deceased husband Pete Tyler.

In reviving the television series after a sixteen-year hiatus (1989–2005), executive producer Russell T Davies was keen to provide a believable background for the Doctor's companion and a context for her travels to the past and future. The character of Jackie was created, along with Rose's on/off boyfriend Mickey, to keep the series grounded in reality. In writing Jackie, Davies incorporated both comic and tragic elements. Following the departure of the Tyler family, Davies was keen to bring Jackie back alongside Rose for future appearances. Reviewers generally reacted positively to the development of the character, though some identified unlikeable traits.","user

"Gangs of New York is a 2002 American epic historical crime film that was directed by Martin Scorsese, set in the New York City slums, and inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1927 nonfiction book ""The Gangs of New York"". The screenplay was written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz.
In 1863, a long-running Catholic–Protestant feud erupts into violence, just as an Irish immigrant group is protesting the low wages caused by an influx of freed slaves as well as the threat of conscription. Scorsese spent 20 years developing the project until Harvey Weinstein and his production company Miramax Films acquired it in 1999.

Made in Cinecittà, Rome, and in New York, the film was completed by 2001, but its release was delayed by the September 11 attacks. Released on December 20, 2002, the film grossed $193 million worldwide against its $100 million budget. Reviewers praised Day-Lewis' performance, Scorsese's directing, and the film's production and costume design but criticized the story. The film received 10 Oscar nominations at the 75th Academy Awards but won none.","user

"Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 gigahertz (GHz) to as low as 30 hertz (Hz). At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm (shorter than a grain of rice); at 30 Hz the corresponding wavelength is 10,000 km (longer than the radius of the Earth). Like all electromagnetic waves, radio waves in a vacuum travel at the speed of light, and in the Earth's atmosphere at a close, but slightly lower speed. Radio waves are generated by charged particles undergoing acceleration, such as time-varying electric currents. Naturally occurring radio waves are emitted by lightning and astronomical objects, and are part of the blackbody radiation emitted by all warm objects.

Radio waves are generated artificially by transmitters and received by radio receivers, using antennas. Radio waves are very widely used in modern technology for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and radio navigation systems, communications satellites, wireless computer networks and many other applications. Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves can diffract around obstacles like mountains and follow the contour of the earth (ground waves), shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and return to earth beyond the horizon (skywaves), while much shorter wavelengths bend or diffract very little and travel on a line of sight, so their propagation distances are limited to the visual horizon.

To prevent interference between different users, the artificial generation and use of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which defines radio waves as ""electromagnetic waves of frequencies arbitrarily lower than 3 000 GHz, propagated in space without artificial guide"". The radio spectrum is divided into a number of radio bands on the basis of frequency, allocated to different uses.","user

"Carlos Ray ""Chuck"" Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist, actor, film producer, and screenwriter. He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and judo. After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do. Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in martial arts. Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the spy film ""The Wrecking Crew"" (1969). Friend and fellow actor Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in ""Way of the Dragon"" (1972). While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested to him that he take it seriously. Norris took the starring role in the action film ""Breaker! Breaker!"" (1977), which turned a profit. His second lead ""Good Guys Wear Black"" (1978) became a hit, and Norris became a popular action film star.

Norris would go on to star in a streak of bankable independently-made action and martial arts films, with ""A Force of One"" (1979), ""The Octagon"" (1980), and ""An Eye for an Eye"" (1981). This made Norris an international celebrity. He went on to make studio films like ""Silent Rage"" (1982) with Columbia, ""Forced Vengeance"" (1982) with MGM, and ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" (1983) with Orion. This led Cannon films to sign Norris into a multiple film deal, starting with ""Missing in Action"" (1984), which proved to be very successful and launched a trilogy. Norris started to work almost exclusively on high-profile action films with Cannon, becoming their leading star during the 1980s. Films with Cannon included ""Invasion U.S.A"" (1985), ""The Delta Force"" (1986), ""Firewalker"" (1986), etc. Apart from the Cannon films, Norris made ""Code of Silence"" (1985), which was received as one of his best films. In the 1990s, he played the title role in the long running television series ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" from 1993 until 2001. Until 2006, Norris continued taking lead roles in action movies, including ""Delta Force 2"" (1990), ""The Hitman"" (1991), ""Sidekicks"" (1992), ""Forest Warrior"" (1996), ""The President's Man"" and its sequel (2002). Norris made his last film appearance to date in Sylvester Stallone's ""The Expendables 2"" (2012).

Throughout his film and TV career Norris diversified from his regular endeavors. He is a noted writer, having penned books on martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christianity, western novels, and biography. He was twice a New York Times bestselling author, first with his book on his personal philosophy of positive force and the psychology of self-improvement based on personal anecdotes called ""The Secret of Inner Strength: My Story"" (1988). His second New York Times Best Seller, ""Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America"" (2008), was about his critique on current issues in the USA. Norris also appeared in several commercials endorsing several products most notably being one of the main spokespersons for the Total Gym infomercials. In 2005, Norris found a new fame on the Internet when Chuck Norris facts became an Internet meme documenting humorous, fictional and often absurd feats of strength and endurance. Although Norris himself did not produce the ""facts"", he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated ""Chuck Norris facts"" in advertising, the phenomenon resulted in six books (two of them ""New York Times"" best sellers), two video games, and several appearances on talk shows, such as ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" where he read the facts or participated in sketches.","user

"Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist (in jazz and popular music). Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal and popular music styles such as pop, rock and electronic dance music.

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual as part of music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.","user

"Schisandraceae is a family of flowering plants with 3 known genera and a total of 92 known species (Luo et al., 2018 [open access] list all known species with their geographic occurrence). Such a family has been recognized by most taxonomists, at least for the past several decades. Before that, the plants concerned were assigned to family Magnoliaceae and Illiciaceae.

The APG IV and APG III systems of taxonomy recognize this family and place it on the order Austrobaileyales.

The APG II system, of 2003, also recognizes such a family. It places the family in order Austrobaileyales, which in turn is accepted as being among the most basic lineages in the clade angiosperms. APG II assumes this to be a family of three genera, the Schisandraceae ""sensu lato"". This family consists of woody plants, containing essential oils.

However, APG II does allow the option of segregating the genus ""Illicium"" as the family Illiciaceae. This leaves only two genera in the family Schisandraceae ""sensu stricto"", consisting of ""Schisandra"" and ""Kadsura"", totalling several dozen species, which are found in tropical to temperate regions of East and Southeast Asia and North America.

The APG system, of 1998, recognized both the families Schisandraceae ""sensu stricto"" and Illiciaceae, unplaced as to order. It regarded both families as being among the most basic lineages in the clade angiosperms.

The Cronquist system, of 1981, treated the plants in the family (in its wider sense) as two separate families, which together constituted

"The Chola dynasty was a Tamil thalassocratic empire of southern India, one of the longest-ruling dynasties in the world's history. The earliest datable references to the Chola are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE left by Ashoka, of the Maurya Empire (Ashoka Major Rock Edict No.13). As one of the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam, along with the Chera and Pandya, the dynasty continued to govern over varying territory until the 13th century CE. Despite these ancient origins, the period when it is appropriate to speak of a ""Chola Empire"" only begins with the medieval Cholas in the mid-9th century CE. 

The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the Kaveri River, but they ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their power from the later half of the 9th century till the beginning of the 13th century. The whole country south of the Tungabhadra was united and held as one state for a period of three centuries and more between 907 and 1215 AD. Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I, Rajadhiraja Chola, Virarajendra Chola, and Kulothunga Chola I, the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia. The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by naval raids on cities of the city-state of Srivijaya, as well as by the repeated embassies to China. The Chola fleet represented the zenith of ancient Indian sea power.

During the period 1010–1153, the Chola territories stretched from the islands of the Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh. Rajaraja Chola conquered peninsular South India, annexed parts of which is now Sri Lanka and occupied the islands of the Maldives. Rajendra Chola sent a victorious expedition to North India that touched the river Ganges and defeated the Pala ruler of Pataliputra, Mahipala. In 1025, he also successfully invaded cities of Srivijaya of Malaysia and Indonesia. Chola invasion ultimately failed to install direct administration over Srivijaya, since the invasion was short and only meant to plunder the wealth of Srivijaya. Chola rule or influence on Srivijava would last until 1070 when the Cholas began to lose almost all of its overseas territories. The Later Cholas (1070-1279) would still rule portions of Southern India. The Chola dynasty went into decline at the beginning of the 13th century with the rise of the Pandyan dynasty, which ultimately caused their downfall.

The Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of Tamil literature and their zeal in the building of temples has resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture. The Chola kings were avid builders and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centers of economic activity. They were also well known for their art, specifically temple sculptures and 'Chola bronzes', exquisite bronze sculptures of Hindu deities built in a lost wax process they pioneered; that continues (to a certain extent) to this day. They established a centralized form of government and a disciplined bureaucracy. The Chola school of art spread to Southeast Asia and influenced the architecture and art of Southeast Asia. The medieval Cholas are best known for the construction of the magnificent Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur, commissioned by the most famous Chola king, Rajaraja Chola in 1010 CE.","user

The earliest datable references to the Chola are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE left by Ashoka, of the Maurya Empire (Ashoka Major Rock Edict No.13). As one of the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam, along with the Chera and Pandya, the dynasty continued to govern over varying territory until the 13th century CE. Despite these ancient origins, the period when it is appropriate to speak of a ""Chola Empire"" only begins with the medieval Cholas in the mid-9th century CE. 

The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the Kaveri River, but they ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their power from the later half of the 9th century till the beginning of the 13th century. The whole country south of the Tungabhadra was united and held as one state for a period of three centuries and more between 907 and 1215 AD. Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I, Rajadhiraja Chola, Virarajendra Chola, and Kulothunga Chola I, the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia. The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by naval raids on cities of the city-state of Srivijaya, as well as by the repeated embassies to China. The Chola fleet represented the zenith of ancient Indian sea power.

During the period 1010–1153, the Chola territories stretched from the islands of the Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh. Rajaraja Chola conquered peninsular South India, annexed parts of which is now Sri Lanka and occupied the islands of the Maldives. Rajendra Chola sent a victorious expedition to North India that touched the river Ganges and defeated the Pala ruler of Pataliputra, Mahipala. In 1025, he also successfully invaded cities of Srivijaya of Malaysia and Indonesia. Chola invasion ultimately failed to install direct administration over Srivijaya, since the invasion was short and only meant to plunder the wealth of Srivijaya. Chola rule or influence on Srivijava would last until 1070 when the Cholas began to lose almost all of its overseas territories. The Later Cholas (1070-1279) would still rule portions of Southern India. The Chola dynasty went into decline at the beginning of the 13th century with the rise of the Pandyan dynasty, which ultimately caused their downfall.

The Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of Tamil literature and their zeal in the building of temples has resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture. The Chola kings were avid builders and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centers of economic activity. They were also well known for their art, specifically temple sculptures and 'Chola bronzes', exquisite bronze sculptures of Hindu deities built in a lost wax process they pioneered; that continues (to a certain extent) to this day. They established a centralized form of government and a disciplined bureaucracy. The Chola school of art spread to Southeast Asia and influenced the architecture and art of Southeast Asia. The medieval Cholas are best known for the construction of the magnificent Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur, commissioned by the most famous Chola king, Rajaraja Chola in 1010 CE.

Pope Leo XIII named him as its archbishop and he set to work prioritizing a range of different pastoral initiatives aimed at revitalizing the faith within people and also prioritizing ecumenical cooperation with other denominations.

Bilczewski aided his people throughout the onslaught of World War I organizing relief and food for those displaced and those who became refugees; he likewise aided beggars and the homeless in his archdiocese. In 1918 he did all he could to smooth tensions during the Polish-Ukrainian War and he collaborated with his brother bishops in helping their people when the conflict escalated; he likewise did the same thing during the Bolshevik occupation of Poland and Ukraine while also collaborating with the apostolic nuncio Achille Ratti - the future Pope Pius XI.

His cause for sainthood commenced in 1944 and he became titled as a Servant of God while the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue allowed for him to be named as Venerable on 18 December 1997.

"Theta Capricorni, Latinized from θ Capricorni, is a white-hued star in the southern constellation of Capricornus, positioned 0.58° south of the ecliptic. Sometimes, this star is called by the name Dorsum, meaning ""the back (of the goat)"" in Latin. It can be seen with the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of +4.07. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 20.11 mas as seen from the Earth, the star is about 162 light years from the Sun. It is drifting closer with a radial velocity of −11 km/s.

This is an ordinary A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A1 V. Radial velocity variations indicate it may be a binary star system, but when the system was examined in the infrared, no companion was detected. Theta Capricorni has an estimated 2.24 times the mass of the Sun and around 2.7 times the Sun's radius. It is 152 million years old and is spinning fairly rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 104 km/s. The star is radiating 65 times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of around 10,000 K.","user

Rugg was born on August 20, 1862 in the town of Sterling, Massachusetts. He was one of five children of Prentice Mason Rugg and Cynthia Ross Rugg. Rugg attended and graduated from Lancaster High School in 1879, then from Amherst College in 1883 and finally from the Boston University School of Law in 1886. He was admitted to the bar in 1886.

Immediately after admittance, Rugg established his practice in Worcester, Massachusetts with John R. Thayer. During this time, Rugg was involved in a number of political organizations. He was a member of Sterling's school committee from 1887. From 1888 to 1890 he was a trustee of the Sterling public library. He was a member of the Worcester city council in 1894 and was president of the group the next year.

In 1889, Rugg married Florence May Belcher. They had three children: sons Charles Belcher and Arthur Prentice Jr. and daughter Sidney H. Writ.

Rugg was elected city solicitor of Worcester in 1897. From this position, Massachusetts governor Curtis Guild Jr. appointed him to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court as an associate justice on September 14, 1906. On September 13, 1911, Massachusetts governor Eugene Foss nominated Rugg to be Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Rugg was the youngest person ever to receive that position.

He served on the court until his death, at his home in Sterling. He died of pneumonia.

Rugg received five honorary LL.D. degrees from schools in Massachusetts: Amherst College in 1908; Harvard University in 1914; Boston University in 1923; Williams College in 1924; Boston College in 1938.","user

"Madaram Brahma was an Indian poet and dramatist, who wrote in the Bodo language, a Sino-Tibetan language spoken by the Bodo people. Born in a Bodo family in 1903 at Kokrajhar in Dundhunikhata (present day Dhubri District) of the Northeast Indian state of Assam, he passed the matriculation from the local Government High School in Dhubri. His career started as a teacher and by 1932, he became the Headmaster of the Harisingha High School, Darang. In 1945 he joined the local administration, eventually becoming the first person of Bodo ethnicity to become a Block Development Officer.

Brahma wrote several poems, songs including hymns and plays which started with ""Boroni Gudi Sibsa Arw Aroj"", a book of hymns and prayers written in Bodo language. His other works included ""Khonthai Methai"" (Poems and Lyrics–1923), ""Boroni Gudi Sipsa Arw Aroj"" (Bodo Hymn and Prayer Songs–1926), Raimali (Drama–1926), ""Dimapur Nwgwr Bainai"" (The fall of Dimapur, drama), ""Sadang Bairagi"" (Sadang, The Sanyasi, drama), ""Rupesri Raithai Khantai"" (Rupesri- Poems and Prose–1988) and ""Phangseao Bibar Barnwi"" (Two Flowers in the Branch). Some of his works are prescribed texts for school curriculum and civil services examination. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1988.

Madaram Brahma died, aged 87, on 6 September 1990, at Rupnath Brahma Civil Hospital in his native place. A local school, ""Padmasri Madaram Brahma Mes School"" is named after him.","user

"The HTC One A9 is an Android smartphone manufactured and marketed by HTC. It was officially announced on October 20, 2015. It is the successor to the HTC One Mini 2 in the Worldwide; but in global markets, it was sold alongside the One M9 as a mid-range offering. It was launched as an effort to improve the revenue of HTC's smartphone business after the failure of the One M9.

It features a unibody aluminum frame with a Super AMOLED HD display and Dolby Surround sound for headphones. It also features a fingerprint sensor which can be used to unlock the phone. It is the first non-Nexus device to be pre-installed with Android Marshmallow and the first non-CDMA phone that is compatible to work with the Verizon network in the United States.

It received mixed reviews following its release. While many critics lent specific praise to its construction and fingerprint scanner, other aspects have generally received indifferent or mixed reception. Some thought that its price point was too high, while others thought it was a clone of the iPhone 6. In November 2015, HTC reported a 15 percent increase in overall revenue.","user

In October 1964 it achieved a number of ""firsts"" in the history of crewed spaceflight, being the first space flight to carry more than one crewman into orbit, the first flight without the use of spacesuits, and the first to carry either an engineer or a physician into outer space. It also set a crewed spacecraft altitude record of .

In October 1964 it achieved a number of ""firsts"" in the history of crewed spaceflight, being the first space flight to carry more than one crewman into orbit, the first flight without the use of spacesuits, and the first to carry either an engineer or a physician into outer space.

"Kind of Blue is a studio album by American jazz trumpeter-composer Miles Davis. It was recorded on March 2 and April 22, 1959, at Columbia's 30th Street Studio in New York City, and released on August 17 of that year by Columbia Records. For the recording, Davis led a sextet featuring saxophonists John Coltrane and Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley, pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb, with new band pianist Wynton Kelly appearing on one track – ""Freddie Freeloader"" – in place of Evans.

In part owing to Evans' joining the ensemble in 1958, Davis departed further from his early work's hard bop style in favor of greater experimentation with musical modes, as he had on his previous album ""Milestones"" (1958). In basing ""Kind of Blue"" entirely on modality, he gave each performer a set of scales that encompassed the parameters of their improvisation and style, and consequently more creative freedom with melodies. Coltrane later expanded on this modal approach in his solo career.

""Kind of Blue"" has been regarded by many critics as the greatest jazz record, Davis's masterpiece, and one of the best albums of all time. Its influence on music, including jazz, rock, and classical genres, has led writers to also deem it one of the most influential albums ever recorded. The album was one of fifty recordings chosen in 2002 by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, and in 2003 it was ranked number 12 on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

Though precise figures have been disputed, ""Kind of Blue"" is often cited as the best-selling jazz record of all time. In 2019, it was certified 5× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over five million copies.","user

"Impetigo is a bacterial infection that involves the superficial skin. The most common presentation is yellowish crusts on the face, arms, or legs. Less commonly there may be large blisters which affect the groin or armpits. The lesions may be painful or itchy. Fever is uncommon.
It is typically due to either ""Staphylococcus aureus"" or ""Streptococcus pyogenes"". Risk factors include attending day care, crowding, poor nutrition, diabetes mellitus, contact sports, and breaks in the skin such as from mosquito bites, eczema, scabies, or herpes. With contact it can spread around or between people. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and appearance.
Prevention is by hand washing, avoiding people who are infected, and cleaning injuries. Treatment is typically with antibiotic creams such as mupirocin or fusidic acid. Antibiotics by mouth, such as cephalexin, may be used if large areas are affected. Antibiotic-resistant forms have been found.
Impetigo affected about 140 million people (2% of the world population) in 2010. It can occur at any age, but is most common in young children. In some places the condition is also known as ""school sores"". Without treatment people typically get better within three weeks. Recurring infections can occur due to colonization of the nose by the bacteria. Complications may include cellulitis or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

"Beverly Hills, 90210 (often referred to by its short title, 90210) is an American teen drama television series created by Darren Star and produced by Aaron Spelling under his production company Spelling Television. The series ran for ten seasons on Fox from October 4, 1990, to May 17, 2000, and is the first of six television series in the ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" franchise. The series follows the lives of a group of friends living in the upscale and star-studded community of Beverly Hills, California, as they transition from high school to college and into the adult world. ""90210"" refers to one of the city's five ZIP codes.

The initial premise of the show was based on the adjustment and culture shock that twins Brandon (Jason Priestley) and Brenda Walsh (Shannen Doherty) experienced when they and their parents, Jim (James Eckhouse) and Cindy (Carol Potter), moved from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Beverly Hills, California. In addition to chronicling the characters' friendships and romantic relationships, the show addressed topical issues such as sex, date rape, homophobia, animal rights, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, eating disorders, antisemitism, racism, teenage suicide, teenage pregnancy, and AIDS.

After poor ratings during its first season, the series gained popularity during the summer of 1991, when Fox aired a special ""summer season"" of the show while most other series were in reruns. Viewership increased dramatically, and ""90210"" became one of Fox's top shows when it returned that fall. The show became a global pop culture phenomenon with its cast members, particularly Jason Priestley and Luke Perry, who became teen idols; the series also made actresses Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth household names in the United States. The show is credited with creating or popularizing the teen soap genre that many other successful television shows followed in the years to come.

The show had many cast changes; Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling, Brian Austin Green, and Ian Ziering were the only actors to appear during its entire run and appeared on the first episode of the spin-off ""Melrose Place"".

On February 27, 2019, it was announced that a six-episode reboot has been ordered by Fox and that the show would simply be titled ""BH90210"". On May 8, 2019, it was announced that the reboot would premiere on August 7, 2019, at 9/8c on Fox.","user

"St Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in London, the capital of the United Kingdom. As the seat of the Bishop of London, the cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. It sits on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the City after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard being the site of St Paul's Cross.

The cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights of London. Its dome, framed by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome remains among the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom after Liverpool Cathedral.

Services held at St Paul's have included the funerals of Admiral Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher; jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer; the launch of the Festival of Britain; and the thanksgiving services for the Silver, Golden and Diamond Jubilees and the 80th and 90th birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II. St Paul's Cathedral is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz.
The cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services. The tourist entry fee at the door is £20 for adults (August 2020, cheaper online), but no charge is made to worshippers attending advertised services.

The nearest underground station is St. Paul's, which is away from St Paul's Cathedral.","user

The series is notable for its innovation with Technicolor and the multiplane motion picture camera, as well as its introduction of the character Donald Duck making his first appearance in the Silly Symphony cartoon ""The Wise Little Hen"" in 1934.

"George Armstrong Custer (December 5, 1839 – June 25, 1876) was a United States Army officer and cavalry commander in the American Civil War and the American Indian Wars.

Custer graduated from West Point in 1861 at the bottom of his class, but as the Civil War was just starting, trained officers were in immediate demand. He worked closely with General George B. McClellan and the future General Alfred Pleasonton, both of whom recognized his qualities as a cavalry leader, and he was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers at age 23. Only a few days after his promotion, he fought at the Battle of Gettysburg, where he commanded the Michigan Cavalry Brigade and despite being outnumbered, defeated J. E. B. Stuart's attack at what is now known as the East Cavalry Field. In 1864, Custer served in the Overland Campaign and in Philip Sheridan's army in the Shenandoah Valley, defeating Jubal Early at Cedar Creek. His division blocked the Army of Northern Virginia's final retreat and received the first flag of truce from the Confederates, and Custer was present at Robert E. Lee's surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox.

After the war, Custer was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army and was sent west to fight in the Indian Wars. On June 25, 1876, while leading the 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana Territory against a coalition of Native American tribes, he was killed along with all of the five companies he led after splitting the regiment into three battalions.

    George Armstrong Custer (December 5, 1839 – June 25, 1876) was a United States Army officer and cavalry commander in the American Civil War and the American Indian Wars.

Custer graduated from West Point in 1861 at the bottom of his class, but as the Civil War was just starting, trained officers were in immediate demand. He worked closely with General George B. McClellan and the future General Alfred Pleasonton, both of whom recognized his qualities as a cavalry leader, and he was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers at age 23. Only a few days after his promotion, he fought at the Battle of Gettysburg, where he commanded the Michigan Cavalry Brigade and despite being outnumbered, defeated J. E. B. Stuart's attack at what is now known as the East Cavalry Field. In 1864, Custer served in the Overland Campaign and in Philip Sheridan's army in the Shenandoah Valley, defeating Jubal Early at Cedar Creek. His division blocked the Army of Northern Virginia's final retreat and received the first flag of truce from the Confederates, and Custer was present at Robert E. Lee's surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox.

After the war, Custer was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army and was sent west to fight in the Indian Wars. On June 25, 1876, while leading the 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana Territory against a coalition of Native American tribes, he was killed along with all of the five companies he led after splitting the regiment into three battalions. This action became romanticized as ""Custer's Last Stand"".
His dramatic end was as controversial as the rest of his career, and reaction to his life and career remains deeply divided. Custer's legend was partly of his own fabrication through his extensive journalism, and perhaps more through the energetic lobbying of his wife Elizabeth Bacon ""Libbie"" Custer throughout her long widowhood.

"The Panavia Tornado is a family of twin-engine, variable-sweep wing multirole combat aircraft, jointly developed and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom and West Germany. There are three primary Tornado variants: the Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) fighter-bomber, the suppression of enemy air defences Tornado ECR (electronic combat/reconnaissance) and the Tornado ADV (air defence variant) interceptor aircraft.

The Tornado was developed and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and Aeritalia of Italy. It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979–1980. Due to its multirole design, it was able to replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) became the only export operator of the Tornado in addition to the three original partner nations. A tri-nation training and evaluation unit operating from RAF Cottesmore, the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment, maintained a level of international co-operation beyond the production stage.

The Tornado was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Italian Air Force, and RSAF during the Gulf War of 1991, in which the Tornado conducted many low-altitude penetrating strike missions. The Tornados of various services were also used in The Bosnian War, Kosovo War, Iraq War, in Libya during the 2011 Libyan civil war, as well as smaller roles in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. Including all variants, 990 aircraft were built.","user

"The Holland Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel under the Hudson River. It connects Lower Manhattan in New York City to the east with Jersey City in New Jersey to the west. An integral conduit within the New York metropolitan area, the Holland Tunnel is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The tunnel carries Interstate 78; the New Jersey side is also designated the eastern terminus of Route 139. The Holland Tunnel is one of three vehicular crossings between Manhattan and New Jersey, the others being the Lincoln Tunnel and the George Washington Bridge.

Plans for a fixed vehicular crossing over the Hudson River were first devised in 1906. However, disagreements prolonged the planning process until 1919, when it was decided to build a tunnel under the river. Construction of the Holland Tunnel started in 1920, and it opened in 1927. At the time of its opening, the Holland Tunnel was the longest continuous underwater vehicular tunnel in the world.

The Holland Tunnel was originally known as the Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel or the Canal Street Tunnel. It was renamed the ""Holland Tunnel"" in memory of Clifford Milburn Holland, the chief engineer, following his sudden death in 1924 before the tunnel was opened. The Holland Tunnel was the world's first mechanically ventilated tunnel; the ventilation system was designed by Ole Singstad, who oversaw the tunnel's completion.","user

"Jan Pietraszko (7 August 1911 - 2 March 1988) was a Polish Roman Catholic bishop who served as one of the auxiliaries for the Kraków archdiocese and Titular Bishop of Turrisblanda from 1962 until his death. Pietraszko was a noted spiritual director and chaplain as well as a popular confessor but was best known for his sermons and for his homiletic writings. He did his ecclesial studies just before World War II broke out and was a brief hostage of the Gestapo after the Nazi forces invaded Poland in 1939.

"The Alajuela Formation, originally Alhajuela Formation (Tau), is a Late Miocene (Tortonian, Early Hemphillian or Latest Clarendonian in the NALMA classification) geologic formation in the Panama Canal Zone of central Panama.

The formation overlies the Caimito Formation and comprises sandstones, limestones and conglomerates deposited in a tidal-dominated estuarine to shallow marine environment.

The formation crops out in a small area along the southern and western shores of Lake Alajuela, of which it derives its name, and preserves a rich fossil faunal assemblage of mammals, fish (among which fossil teeth of megalodon), invertebrates and flora.

    The Alajuela Formation, originally Alhajuela Formation (Tau), is a Late Miocene (Tortonian, Early Hemphillian or Latest Clarendonian in the NALMA classification) geologic formation in the Panama Canal Zone of central Panama.

The formation overlies the Caimito Formation and comprises sandstones, limestones and conglomerates deposited in a tidal-dominated estuarine to shallow marine environment.

The formation crops out in a small area along the southern and western shores of Lake Alajuela, of which it derives its name, and preserves a rich fossil faunal assemblage of mammals, fish (among which fossil teeth of megalodon), invertebrates and flora. The fauna is of paleontological significance as an insight into the ecosystem of Central America preceding the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI).

"The ACTS Gigabit Satellite Network was a pioneering, high-speed communications satellite network in the years 1993-2004, created as a prototype system to explore high-speed networking of digital endpoints. The system was jointly sponsored by NASA and ARPA, implemented by BBN Technologies and Motorola, and was inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame in April 1997.

The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) network was designed to provide fiber-compatible SONET service to remote nodes and networks through a wideband satellite system, and provided long‐haul, point‐to‐point and point‐to‐multipoint full‐duplex SONET services, at rates up to 622 Mbit/s, over NASA's Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS).

The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite itself, built and operated by Lockheed Martin, was launched on STS-51 on September 12, 1993, by the Space Shuttle Discovery, and occupied a geostationary orbit at 100° west longitude. It was the first communication satellite to operate in the 20-30 GHz frequency band (Ka-Band), with 30 GHz uplink and 20 GHz downlink signals. The satellite incorporated advanced on-board switching and multiple dynamically-hopping spot-beam antennas for selected areas of the United States including Hawaii. Up to 3 uplink and 3 downlink antenna beams could be active simultaneously.

The ACTS network ground terminals were transportable Gigabit Earth Stations (GES) with fiber-optic SONET interfaces (OC-3 and OC-12), which also supported the Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) protocol suite. The network control and management functions are distributed in the various Gigabit Earth Stations, with the operator's interface being centralized in a Network Management Terminal (NMT), which could be collocated at a GES, or anywhere in the Internet. 

The system was operational and used for experiments for 127 months, instead of the originally planned 24-48 months. In all, 53 terminals were built and used by more than 100 experimenters to test ACTS abilities. In Nov. 1997 a record data rate of 520 Mbit/s TCP/IP throughput was achieved using ATM between several ground stations via ACTS. On May 31, 2000 the ACTS experiments program officially came to a close, but the system continued to support experiments until it was deactivated on April 28, 2004.","user

"The Statue of Metjen is on display in the Egyptian Museum in Berlin and has the inventory number ÄM 1106. The statue was discovered at Abusir in Metjen's mastaba by the Egyptian expedition (1842–1845) under the direction of the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius. The statue and the mastaba were bought to the museum in Berlin. The statue is an early example of an Egyptian statue belonging to a private individual. Metjen lived at the end of the Third and the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty (around 2600 BC). The statue is made of granite and about 47 cm high. It is datable under king Snofru.

Metjen is shown sitting on a chair. His right hand forms a fist and is placed on the chest, the left hand is placed on the leg. Metjen wears short curly hair. On the sides of the chair are inscriptions providing Metjen's name and his titles. The statue was once placed in the serdab of the mastaba and was therefore only visible via a small hole in the wall.

The statue belongs to the small group of private statues datable to the Egyptian Third Dynasty and earliest Fourth Dynasty. They are all made of hard stone and appear somehow clumsy and heavy. The statue of Metjen is the latest one of them. The statue belongs therefore stylistically between those of the Third Dynasty and those of the Fourth Dynasty. Its head is slightly too large, the small dimensions and the hieroglyphic texts in raised relief connects the statue with the Third Dynasty. Typical for the Fourth Dynasty are the positions of the hands and the chair, that does no longer copies a real chair as in the Third Dynasty.","user

"Colt Defender Mark I was an American multi-barreled shotgun intended for law enforcement or military use, completed in 1967. The shotgun was essentially a volley gun with eight single-shot barrels — each chambered for the 20-gauge 3-inch magnum shell — arranged in a octagonal fashion around the central axis, and could fire eight individual times like a semi-automatic action without the complexity of actually being a semi-automatic firearm. The action ran on a revolver-like rotating striker mechanism. The gun had a detachable buttstock and a pistol grip with a double-action trigger, and had a separate foregrip up front for instinctive shooting. 

The shotgun was extremely simple to operate and very robust. The designer, Robert Hillberg, thoroughly tested the weapon before seeking out a manufacturer. The design proved to be so correct, that only a couple of minor changes were made for manufacturing. When Colt Industries was contacted, they showed considerable interest in producing the weapon, but before committing to full production they insisted on a market survey to see if there was an adequate market for the gun. Colt demonstrated the weapon to a number of departments, and all who saw it were impressed with its compactness, volume of fire and reliability. However, the national recession at that time did not allow any adoption of the weapon and by 1971 the project was over.

The weapon was composed of an aluminum alloy receiver with steel inserts and was covered in an epoxy paint finish. The final version of the weapon was available in 4 variants. The first variant was a simplified one, with no special features. The second variant incorporated a barrel selector on the rotating striker on the hammer that allowed the shooter to select any one of the eight barrels, meaning that the weapon could be loaded with a variety of ammunition and the shooter could choose the most appropriate round for the given situation. The third variant contained a receptacle for a tear gas canister among the barrels, and pressing the trigger on the foregrip allowed the shooter to spray the target with tear gas, giving him a non-lethal option. The fourth and final variant had both the barrel selector and the tear gas canister.","user

"Azolla primaeva is an extinct species of ""water fern"" in the family Salviniaceae known from Eocene fossils from the Ypresian stage (), found in southern British Columbia.

The species was first described from poorly preserved material collected in the Similkameen River area near Princeton, British Columbia and later noted from outcrops at Stump Lake northeast of Princeton. The fossils were described by David P. Penhallow in the 1890 volume ""On Fossil Plants from the Smilkameen Valley and Other Places in the Southern Interior of British Columbia"". Though the volume only lists John William Dawson as author, Dawson notes that the ""A primaevum"" description had been written by Penhallow. Due to the poor nature of the type specimen the species was placed in the form genus ""Azollophyllum"" as ""Azollophyllum primaevum"" indicating its similarity to the modern genus, but at the same time acknowledging lack of detail needed to confirm its placement in the genus.

Placement of the species was formally changed with the publication of a paper written by Chester A. Arnold based on new fossil specimens collected near the former mining camp of Ashnola, British Columbia, approximately 8 miles south of Princeton along the Similkimeen River. The fossils were recovered from strata of the Allenby Formation, at the time considered Oligocene age, but now known to be of the Early Middle Eocene.

The specimens were studied by Arnold of the University of Michigan who published the 1955 type redescription for ""A. primaeva"" in the ""Contributions from the Museum of. Paleontology, University of Michigan"", Volume 12. Arnold noted the new specimens to consist of leafy vegetation and roots often forming mats in the rock. The plants are accompanied by microspore massulae and megasporangia.

At the time this paper was published, four species of ""Azolla"" had been described from the fossil record. The oldest species at that time was ""A. intertrappea"" from Eocene age strata in India and described in 1934 by Birbal Sahni and H. S. Rao. Also in 1934, Roland W. Brown described a similarly aged species, ""A. berryi"", from the Middle Eocene Green River Formation. An Oligocene species, ""A. prisca"", was published from the London Clays of England eight years earlier in 1926 by Marjorie E.J. Chandler and Eleanor M. Reid. The youngest of the fossil species was ""A. tertiaria"" described by Edward W. Berry in 1927 from Pliocene fossils found in the Esmeralda Formation of Nevada. Arnold notes that with the placement of ""A. primaeva"" into the genus ""Azolla"" means that its description in 1890 was actually the earliest species described from the fossil record.

After comparing the new fossil specimens to both modern and fossil species as much as he was able with the descriptions available, Arnold noted ""A. primaeva"" to be close in morphology to the living ""A.filiculoides"" and the Eocene ""A. intertrappea"" of India. Fossil specimens of ""Azolla"" have been recovered from the closely related strata of the Klondike Mountain Formation around Republic, Washington, but have not been described to species.","user

"Dankvart Dreyer (13 June 1816 – 4 November 1852) was a Danish landscape painter of the Copenhagen School of painters who was educated under the guidance of Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. Around 1840, he was part of the emerging National Romantic landscape painting scene in Denmark but as a result of his over-dramatic and excessively natural style, he did not fit the aesthetics and the ideology of the period. After being widely criticized, he turned his back on the artistic establishment and passed into near oblivion. In 1852, when only 36 years old, he died from typhus.

Posthumously, half a century after his death, his reputation was restored, prompted by the art historian Karl Madsen, and today he is considered to be one of the leading Danish landscape painters of his day, the peer of his more famous contemporaries P. C. Skovgaard and Johan Lundbye.","user

"The Circuit des Champs de Bataille was a multiple-stage road bicycle race held in northern France, Belgium and Luxembourg between 28 April and 11 May 1919. The race was composed of seven stages, with the first stage starting in and the last stage finishing in Strasbourg, a city in Alsace that with the end of hostilities had again become part of France. The stages took the race to Luxembourg City, Brussels, Amiens, Paris, Bar-le-Duc and Belfort. The race was approximately long, with riders covering around per day, with a rest day in between each stage. 

The race was organised by the newspaper ""Le Petit Journal"" as a means of reinvigorating bicycle racing in the region following World War I, to honour those who died in the war and for publicity purposes for the newspaper. It was announced on 5 January 1919, less than two months after the armistice of 11 November 1918. Although Europe was in the midst of reconstruction and then at the height of the deadly flu pandemic, the ""Petit Journal""'s 8,500 franc purse, the equivalent of four years' wages for a typical working man, guaranteed that the race would attract top talent. The newspaper also organised a number of other sporting events during 1919, including a football tournament for the liberated regions, an air race, a cross-country running race, a swimming competition and a boxing match. Although 140 riders registered for the race, many could not train or muster basic equipment, leaving just 87 riders to start the race in Strasbourg, including the prominent riders Oscar Egg, Jean Alavoine, Ali Neffati (who wore a fez) and Paul Duboc, as well as future cycling champions Jules Vanhevel, Lucien Buysse and Albert Dejonghe. The race was won by the Belgian Charles Deruyter, who finished with a lead of 2 hours 25 minutes. He was reportedly so cold at the end of the third stage that he was unable to sign his name, having astonished observers at the finish line of the second stage by crossing in a full-length woman's fur coat that had been given to him by a spectator along the way.

Historian Christopher Thompson reports that of the 87 riders who started the race, only 13 successfully finished it. It has since been described as the toughest cycle race in history. World War I had reduced many of the towns and villages that the race passed through to rubble. ""Le Petit Journal"" reported on ""terrible weather, broken roads, freezing wind and icy conditions"". Some local newspapers had warned before the event that the roads were in such a poor condition as to be unsuitable, but the organisers argued that these conditions bestowed prestige on the race, citing military cyclists who used the same roads under machine-gun fire. Given only rudimentary directions, riders had to search through piles of rubble at various crossroads to find signage directing them to the next town; some former villages were discernable only by smears of red brick dust. As a result of shortages caused by the war, the competitors also had to deal with poor supplies of food and poor-quality tires. Newspapers including ""Le Petit Journal"" and ""L'Auto"" did not see the difficulties of the event as evidence of the state of post-war France, but rather celebrated the race's competitors as ""heroic survivors"" who symbolised national revival; some 67 professional French cyclists were known to have died during the conflict. Upon its completion, the event's organisers called it a ""victory ... for the French race"". The publication ""Vélo-Sport"" praised the Belgian participants as ""géants de courage et de volonté"" (""heroes of courage and willpower"") who had given the public ""lessons in vigour"".

A race of the same name was held again in 1920, but it was organised as a one-day race rather than a stage race. This event was won by the French rider Henri Pélissier.","user

"The Regulation of Railways Act 1868 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is one of the Railway Regulation Acts 1840 to 1893. 

It was enacted following the first murder on the railways, that of Thomas Briggs by Franz Muller near Hackney in 1864. 

The Act made new provisions for:

* ensuring a method was available for allowing passengers to communicate with the train's guard, if the train was scheduled to travel more than 20 miles without stopping; 
* establishing a fine for passengers raising the alarm without due cause (warnings of this fact still routinely appear near train emergency alarms);
* removing trees near railway lines that might fall and block the train;
* a penalty for trespassing on the railway.

Despite the legislation, it was not until 1899 that internal emergency wires came to be used on the majority of trains.

The Act also made provision for the construction and working of a railway as a Light Railway, 'subject to such conditions and regulations as the Board of Trade may from time to time impose or make'. Section 28 of the Act laid down maximum permitted axle weights and specified that 'the regulations respecting the speed of trains shall not authorize a rate of speed exceeding at any time twenty-five miles an hour'. The Light Railways Act 1896 subsequently introduced more comprehensive legislation governing light railways.","user

The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the office pairs into couples so that they may all be able to take advantage of a Valentine's Day discount at a mini-mall. After Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) returns from his boat trip, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) decides that she is going to break up with him so that she can be with Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), but Pete begins to doubt her. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) share lunch with Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos).

""Couples Discount"" received mixed reviews from television critics and was viewed by 4.15 million viewers and received 2.1/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ultimately ranked fourth in its timeslot. Despite this, ""The Office"" ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night.","user

"11 Puppis is a single star in the southern constellation of Puppis, located approximately 522 light years away based on parallax. It has the Bayer designation j Puppis; ""11 Puppis"" is the Flamsteed designation. This object is visible to the naked eye as a faint, yellow-white star with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.20. It is moving further from the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of +13.3 km/s.

"""Freedom Deep"" is the fourth and final single from the 1993 album, ""Full Moon, Dirty Hearts"", by Australian rock band INXS. The song was written by Andrew Farriss and Michael Hutchence.

""Freedom Deep"" was played live at The Great Music Experience in Nara, Japan in May 1994 at the UNESCO Concert, the idea being to bring together Japanese and Western Music. The song arrangement was backed up by a unique selection of Japanese instruments which fitted in perfectly with the songs' musical style.

    ""Freedom Deep"" is the fourth and final single from the 1993 album, ""Full Moon, Dirty Hearts"", by Australian rock band INXS. The song was written by Andrew Farriss and Michael Hutchence.

""Freedom Deep"" was played live at The Great Music Experience in Nara, Japan in May 1994 at the UNESCO Concert, the idea being to bring together Japanese and Western Music. The song arrangement was backed up by a unique selection of Japanese instruments which fitted in perfectly with the songs' musical style. Other artists at the Event were Bob Dylan, Bon Jovi and Joni Mitchell.

The single was only released in Japan and Australia, where it charted at #111 on the ARIA singles chart.

"The Turnbull Government was the federal executive government of Australia led by the 29th Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, from 2015 to 2018. It succeeded the Abbott Government, which brought the Coalition to power at the 2013 Australian federal election. The Government consisted of members of Australia's Liberal-Nationals Coalition. Turnbull took office by challenging his leader, Tony Abbott, in an internal leadership ballot. Warren Truss, the leader of the Nationals, served as Deputy Prime Minister until he retired in 2016 and was replaced by Barnaby Joyce. Joyce resigned in February 2018 and the Nationals' new leader Michael McCormack became Deputy Prime Minister. The Turnbull Government concluded with Turnbull's resignation ahead of internal leadership ballot which saw him succeeded as Prime Minister by Scott Morrison and the Morrison Government.

In mounting his 2015 public challenge for the leadership, Turnbull cited extended poor polling in Newspoll by the Abbott Government and said Australia needed a new style of ""economic leadership"". Turnbull appointed Morrison as Treasurer in an expanded ministry, promoting several key supporters. Julie Bishop remained as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Conservatives Tony Abbott, Eric Abetz and Kevin Andrews were sent to the backbench. Joe Hockey left Parliament. The Turnbull Government continued a number of Abbott Government initiatives, promising a plebiscite legalising same-sex marriage, concluding Abbott era initiatives on an anti-domestic violence campaign, funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme, signing a China free trade deal, and reforming Senate voting.

The April 2016 refusal of the Senate to pass the Government's bill to re-establish a watchdog for the construction industry provided Turnbull with a double dissolution trigger. An election was held on 2 July, and the government was returned with its majority in the House of Representatives reduced to one seat. The 2016 election saw a resurgence of the right wing Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, and discontented conservative Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi left the party and established the Australian Conservatives soon after. The now elected Turnbull Government secured passage of the Registered Organisations and Australian Building and Construction Commission legislation. In 2017, it announced Federal funds for expansion of Snowy Hydro. In June 2017, it introduced the ""Gonski 2.0"" reforms to schools funding. Factional strains continued.

Turnbull's ousting of Abbott had divided the Liberal Party rank and file and tensions continued in the parliamentary Party. Abbott said Turnbull supporters had plotted against him. The Government reached the 30-consecutive-Newspoll-losses benchmark Turnbull had used to unseat Abbott, in April 2018. The Parliament faced a period of instability under the 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, and the Turnbull Government briefly lost its parliamentary majority and Deputy Prime Minister Joyce. Joyce was re-elected, but in February 2018 Turnbull denounced him and forced his resignation after the press reported on an office affair he had been conducting with a staffer. By-election losses in July 2018 further diminished Turnbull's authority. Dissent from conservative MPs over issues such as energy prices and immigration levels grew during Turnbull's final months. On 21 August, Turnbull announced a leadership spill ahead of his 39th consecutive Newspoll loss, which he narrowly won against Peter Dutton. Turnbull resigned three days later after narrowly losing the confidence of his Party room. Turnbull blamed Abbott, Dutton and conservative media commentators.","user

"Marsu Productions, or simply Marsu, is a publishing house and licensing and merchandising company located in Monaco, managing Franco-Belgian comics characters and copyright concerns, chiefly from the comics universe of André Franquin. The name Marsu refers to one of Franquin's best known characters the Marsupilami, but the company also handles the character universes of ""Gaston Lagaffe"", ""Le Petit Noël"", ""Les Monstres"", as well as François Walthéry's ""Natacha"" and ""Le P'tit bout d'chique"", and ""Léonid et Spoutnika"" by Yann and Philippe Bercovici among others.

Franquin, who had previously worked for the publishing house Dupuis, decided to leave his company and start his own in 1987. He brought along his own creations ""Marsupilami"" and ""Gaston Lagaffe"", and the company soon started 
launching a series of ""Marsupilami"" albums continuing publication of the character Franquin had created in 1952, while working on the series ""Spirou et Fantasio"" for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine ""Spirou"". Since Spirou and Fantasio weren't Franquin's own creations, the publisher Dupuis retained the rights to the characters. Several of the characters under Marsu management are however closely associated with this series, and ""Marsupilami"", ""Gaston Lagaffe"", and ""Le Petit Noël"" are to varying degrees spin-off series.

The first publication, ""La Queue du Marsupilami"" in 1987 with art by Batem and stories by Greg, launched its new series, which by 2007 had passed 20 issues. ""Natacha"" made the switch from Dupuis to Marsu in 1989 with the album ""Cauchemirage"", and ended serial production in ""Spirou"". In 1992, Franquin also added worldwide rights of ""Gaston Lagaffe"" to Marsu, a series he also created for ""Spirou"". The ""Marsupilami"" album numbered 0, ""Capturez un Marsupilami"", the only album featuring Franquin's seminal stories, was published in 2002, some time after Franquin's death in 1997.

"Cantus Arcticus, Op. 61, is a 1972 orchestral composition by the Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara. It is one of his best-known works.

Subtitled ""Concerto for Birds and Orchestra"", it incorporates tape recordings of birdsong recorded near the Arctic Circle, and on the bogs of Liminka, in northern Finland.

The work is in three movements: ""The bog"" opens with a flute duet, after which the other woodwinds join in, followed by the birds. The second movement, ""Melancholy"", features a slowed-down recording of the song of the shore lark. The final movement, ""Swans migrating"", takes the form of a long crescendo for orchestra, with the sounds of whooper swans. At the end both birdsong and orchestra fade, as if into the distance.

""Cantus Arcticus"" was commissioned by the University of Oulu for its first doctoral degree ceremony and premièred on 18 October 1972 with Stephen Portman conducting.","user

"The Mariana dam disaster, also known as the Bento Rodrigues or Samarco dam disaster, occurred on 5 November 2015, when the Fundão tailings dam at the Germano iron ore mine of the Samarco Mariana Mining Complex near Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil, suffered a catastrophic failure, resulting in flooding that devastated the downstream villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo (40 km (25 mi) from Bento Rodrigues), killing 19 people. The extent of the damage caused by the tailings dam collapse is the largest ever recorded with pollutants spread along of watercourses.

The failure of the dam released 43.7 million cubic metres of mine tailings into the Doce River, causing a toxic brown mudflow to pollute the river and beaches near the mouth when it reached the Atlantic Ocean 17 days later. The disaster created a humanitarian crisis as hundreds were displaced and cities along the Doce River suffered water shortages when their water supplies were polluted.

The total impact of the disaster, including the reason for failure and the environmental consequences, are officially under investigation and remain unclear. The owner of the Bento Rodrigues dam, Samarco, was subject to extensive litigation and government sanctions. In 2016, charges of manslaughter and environmental damage were filed against 21 executives, including Samarco's former CEO and representatives from Samarco's owners, Vale and BHP Billiton, on its board of directors.

"Stenopterygii are a superorder of ray-finned fish in the infraclass Teleostei. Their validity is somewhat doubtful, as the group was established to separate, out of a large group of closely related Teleostei, a mere two rather peculiarly autapomorphic orders at best. In some treatments, it is even monotypic.

As originally conceived, the ""Stenopterygii"" include the Ateleopodiformes and Stomiiformes. Sometimes, the former are removed to form a monotypic superorder Ateleopodomorpha. These lineages are moderately advanced teleosts, but each is uniquely adapted to a deep-water oceanic environment. Their plesiomorphies are similar to the Salmoniformes and other Protacanthopterygii, but plesiomorphic traits are no reliable indicator of a close relationship. Nonwithstanding, the ""Stenopterygii"" appear to be close relatives of the Protacanthopterygii. Some cladistic analyses find at least the Stomiiformes deep within the latter superorder.

It thus cannot be ruled out that the ""Stenopterygii"" are better included in the Protacanthopterygii. An alternative approach is to consider the entire group – ""Stenopterygii"", Protacanthopterygii, the monotypic superorders ""Cyclosquamata"", and perhaps the monotypic superorders ""Lampridiomorpha"" and ""Scopelomorpha"" – an unranked clade named Euteleostei. But this would probably require splitting up the Protacanthopterygii, so that each euteleost superorder would at most contain 2 orders (though most would be monotypic), as the relative placement of all these groups is not very well resolved. Such a profusion of monotypic taxa is generally rejected by modern taxonomy, if it is not absolutely required to adequately reflect phylogeny.

Moreover, owing to the uncertain relationships of the euteleosts to the less advanced Otocephala (which include the superorders Clupeomorpha and Ostariophysi) and the more advanced teleosts (e.g. Acanthopterygii), it may well be that the supposed ""clade"" is merely an evolutionary grade. Such a paraphyletic group would according to modern understanding not warrant a taxon name at all. In this case, a possible solution would be to expand the Protacanthopterygii to subsume all the small ""superorders"", and to treat the Euteleostei as including the Protacanthopterygii and their more ""modern"" relatives.","user

But this would probably require splitting up the Protacanthopterygii, so that each euteleost superorder would at most contain 2 orders (though most would be monotypic), as the relative placement of all these groups is not very well resolved. Such a profusion of monotypic taxa is generally rejected by modern taxonomy, if it is not absolutely required to adequately reflect phylogeny.

Moreover, owing to the uncertain relationships of the euteleosts to the less advanced Otocephala (which include the superorders Clupeomorpha and Ostariophysi) and the more advanced teleosts (e.g. Acanthopterygii), it may well be that the supposed ""clade"" is merely an evolutionary grade. Such a paraphyletic group would according to modern understanding not warrant a taxon name at all. In this case, a possible solution would be to expand the Protacanthopterygii to subsume all the small ""superorders"", and to treat the Euteleostei as including the Protacanthopterygii and their more ""modern"" relatives.

"Charles Pomerantz (c. 1896 – June 1, 1973) was a pest control expert and self-trained entomologist who played a pivotal role in identifying the etiology of a 1946 outbreak in New York City of what was later named rickettsialpox. In subsequent years, he spoke before audiences at colleges and other public forums about the menace from pests.

Pomerantz was born in Poland and came to the United States as a child. He grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where he attended P.S. 20. He had originally started in a business manufacturing ladies coats, but switched to pest control as a means of performing a greater service to the community.

After visiting an apartment complex in Queens where a series of people had become sick with unusual rashes, Pomerantz inspected the site and discovered the mites near the building's incinerator rooms and reported his findings to health officials. Visiting the stricken Kew Gardens, Queens complex with physician Robert Huebner, the two peeled back wallpaper to find the walls swarming with mites, so much so that tenants had described that ""the walls had movement"". Huebner's investigations on the site led to the conclusion that tenants had been bitten by a mite identified as ""Allodermanyssus sanguineus"", found on mice that infested the storerooms and incinerator areas in the buildings. Pomerantz was credited with identifying this as a zoonotic disease spread through mice and the mites that infested them. After culturing and isolating the organism in laboratory mice, the pathogen they named ""Rickettsia akari"" was identified as the ultimate cause of the disease now called rickettsialpox. The Department of Health announced a program to work with building owners to exterminate the mice that were the vector for the disease. Over 500 cases of the disease were diagnosed in New York City from 1947 to 1951.

Pomerantz spoke about the importance of rodent control in densely populated areas in a March 1949 lecture to students and faculty members of the Harvard School of Public Health. Pomerantz noted that many mite-born illnesses may be misidentified as chickenpox, hives or scabies, and that physicians and entomologists needed to be prepared for the symptoms of these illnesses spread by mites.

In 1949, Dr. Edward W. Baker of the United States Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine honored Pomerantz with the naming of a mite discovered in peach orchards in the Southern United States, calling it ""Pomerantzia charlesi"" in recognition of Pomerantz's work. A species of flea discovered in the Philippines was named for him in 1951 as ""Stivalius pomerantzi"". Over the course of his career, he was also honored by having his name given to a crane fly and a group of prostigmatic mites.

A resident of Hallandale Beach, Florida, Pomerantz died there at age 76 on June 1, 1973. He was survived by his wife, a daughter and a grandchild.","user

"Adam Doboszyński was a soldier of the Polish Army, writer, anti-Semitic right-wing politician, and a social activist. Born in 1904 in Kraków, he was murdered by the Communist secret services in 1949, in the notorious Mokotów Prison in Warsaw.

Doboszyński was born in Kraków on 11 January 1904, in a noble family. His father Adam was a lawyer and a member of the Austrian Imperial Council. During the Polish-Soviet War, sixteen-year old Doboszyński volunteered to the 6th Regiment of Heavy Artillery in Kraków, serving for four months. After graduation from high school, Doboszyński went to study law at the University of Warsaw. He did not stay there long, moving to Free City of Danzig, to study at the ""Technische Hochschule der Freien Stadt Danzig"" (currently: Gdańsk University of Technology). He was an active member of Polish national organizations in Danzig in the 1920s. Among others, he was chairman of the ""Association of Gdańsk Academics Vistula"" and co-founded of the Brotherly Help of the Association of Polish Students. Doboszyński also participated in three Congresses of the International Conference of Students.

In 1925 he graduated from the ""Technische Hochschule"" with the diploma of construction engineer. In 1925 - 1927, Doboszyński continued his education at the Sciences Po in Paris, but was forced to quit his studies early due to his family's financial difficulties. After the return to Poland, he completed a course at the ""Officer Cadet Sapper School"" in Dęblin, after which Doboszyński was promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant in reserve. In the late 1920s, Doboszyński returned to his family real estate, located in the village of Chorowice near Kraków, where he wrote his first books. In 1928, he wrote a novel ""Słowo ciężarne"" (""Pregnant Word""). Also, he wrote ""Szlakiem Malthusa"" (""Following Thomas Robert Malthus""), and an unpublished drama ""Trans"" (""Trance""). Furthermore, Doboszyński was active in the local Polish landed gentry circles, holding the post of a secretary in Kraków Branch of the Association of Landowners (1929 - 1931).

In 1931, Doboszyński became a member of Camp of Great Poland and since then was associated with Polish right-wing, national movement. In 1933, during a trip to England, he met G. K. Chesterton, whose ideas greatly influenced the Polish activist. In 1934, he wrote a book ""Gospodarka narodowa"" (""National Economy""), which was enthusiastically welcomed by right-wing activists. The book was a great success, it was reprinted three times, fourth reprint was terminated by the outbreak of the war.

Doboszyński's view of Polish national economy was shaped by the works of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. His critique of liberal capitalism and collectivism was based on the teachings of the Roman Catholic church. Doboszyński argued that both capitalism and communism, seemingly so different from each other, were based on anti-Christian, materialistic outlook. His views of national economy were shaped by the teachings of St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. He criticized liberal capitalism, regarding it as immoral. He expressed the opinion that both liberal capitalism and communism were joined by collectivism, and in his opinion, both doctrines had the same root, which was materialistic outlook. According to his philosophy, communist destroyed the human existence, exploiting an individual in the name of the creation of utopia. The process of mindless industrialization and centralization of economy was evil in his view, contributing to the moral decline of societies and exploitation of humans.

According to Doboszyński, the alternative to liberal capitalism in Poland was the creation of a national society, which was able to defend the nation from the concentration of industry. The society should be built like a human organism, in which an individual should not feel alienated, but be supported by the family and the homeland. The basis of a new economic regime was to be trade corporations of both employers and employees. Also, stratification of society was to remain untouched.

In 1934, Doboszyński joined Kraków Branch of the National Party (Poland), in which he was responsible for propaganda. He was regarded as a skillful administration, who built party structures in the region. He traveled across Poland, giving speeches to the workers of industrial centers of Bielsko-Biała, Łódź, Częstochowa or Borysław. Furthermore, he created mobile libraries, which toured the country, presenting national camp publications to the readers. Doboszyński co-created ""Polish Labor"" trade unions, which remained under control of the National Party. He published a number of press articles, remaining in close contact with other activists of the party. Due to his activities, he was frequently harassed by the police, and was close to imprisonment at the infamous Bereza Kartuska prison.

On the night of 22-23 June 1936 Doboszyński carried out the so-called Raid of Myślenice. A group of national activists, commanded by him, seized control of the town of Myślenice, disarming a local police station and cutting telephone wires. Windows of several Jewish-owned businesses were broken, and goods from these stores were carried out to the main market square, where they were set on fire. The raid was a response to the killing of National Party politician Wawrzyniec Sielski, who had been shot by the police in February 1936. In the morning of June 23, Doboszyński's unit retreated from Myślenice. It was followed by the police forces, which twice clashed with the national activists, who were heading southwards, to the Czechoslovak border. Most activists were captured, two were killed in the clashes. Doboszyński himself decided to voluntarily surrender to the police on 30 June.

During the first interrogation, Doboszyński claimed that he was to be blamed for the raid. His trial began in Kraków on 14 June 1937, as one of the most famous political trials of the Second Polish Republic. Doboszyński claimed in court that he carried out the raid in protest of police terror of the Sanacja regime. He was acquitted by the jury, but the decision was protested by the Appellate Tribunal. In February 1938 in Lwów, Doboszyński was found guilty of only one charge: seizing weapons from police post. He was sentenced for three and half years, but was released in February 1939 due to deteriorating health. Doboszyński remained actively involved in politics in the last months of the Second Polish Republic. During the April 1939 Congress of the National Party, he supported Zygmunt Berezowski.

In September 1939, Doboszyński joined Polish Army as a volunteer. Wounded near Lwów, he managed to escape from German captivity to Hungary and finally to France and Great Britain. For his military heroism, he was awarded the Cross of Valour (Poland) and the Croix de Guerre. In the early 1940s, while in Great Britain, Doboszyński remained in the service as a colonel. At the same time, he continued his political activity, publicly criticizing the National Party and its chairman Tadeusz Bielecki for its submission to the government in exile of General Władysław Sikorski. He actively worked on the creation of a wide national - Catholic bloc of several political movements. Doboszyński continued promoting Catholic-based ideas of a nation and social regime. In 1941 - 1941, together with Father Stanisław Bełch he published ""I am a Pole"" magazine, in which he criticized General Sikorski for his pro-Soviet stance. In his opinion, Sikorski was a weak man, whose career was based on his affiliations with French politicians.

In April 1941 Doboszyński was sent to a camp of Sikorski's opponents, located on the Isle of Bute in Scotland. He remained there until January 1942. After release, he continued his critique of Sikorski. In February 1943 he published an open letter, urging President Władysław Raczkiewicz and General Kazimierz Sosnkowski to overthrow Sikorski. The letter was supported by several Polish circles, but Doboszyński was arrested and then expelled from the army.

Following the war, Doboszyński remained in London. He lived in poverty, with occasional help provided by his friends from former Polish Armed Forces. Despite these problems, he continued writing. In 1945, he wrote in English ""Economics of charity"", and two years later completed the ""Pocket Encyclopedia of Social Notions"", and ""Two Platforms of Nationalism"". He also translated into Polish G.K. Chesterton's ""A Short History of England"" and Christopher Hollins' ""Breakdown of Money"". Furthermore, he remained politically active, as a member of a group called the ""Generation of Independent Poland"", in which he promoted the creation of a federation of Central European states, as a counterbalance against the expansion of Russia and Germany. Doboszyński also supported the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations.

Doboszyński strongly opposed all kinds of uprisings, regarding them as unnecessary and pernicious to the Polish nation. In November 1943 he published a text ""The Economy of Blood"", in which he argued that any uprising, breaking out in occupied Poland, would be as tragic as Polish 19-th century, failed insurrections. He also opposed the Third World War against the Soviet Union, arguing that it would not result in Poland's independence.

In December 1946 Doboszyński secretly returned to Poland. He wanted to personally become acquainted with political, economical and social situation of the country. Also, he wanted to meet with leaders of anticommunist guerilla movement, to tell them that they should not expect any support from the West. By early 1947, he was openly traveling across the country, meeting with national and Catholic activists. His plan was to created a strong national-Catholic organization, which would eventually created a stronger Poland. His activities were closely monitored by the Communist agents, as most of his partners were arrested.

In early summer 1947, Doboszyński completed his last work, ""Half Way"", which contained his opinion on the situation of Poland, prognosis for the future and advice for the national movement. On 3 July 1947 he was arrested in Poznań. His investigation was personally carried out by Józef Różański, who tortured Doboszyński. On 18 June 1949 Doboszyński's show trial began in the Regional Military Court in Warsaw. Doboszyński was accused of cooperation with intelligence services of both Nazi Germany and the United States. On 11 July 1949 Doboszyński was sentenced to death, with Bolesław Bierut refusing to pardon him. The sentence was carried out on 29 August 1949. Doboszyński was shot in the back of the head, at the infamous Mokotów Prison. His symbolic grave is located at the Powązki Cemetery.","user

    Adam Doboszyński was a soldier of the Polish Army, writer, anti-Semitic right-wing politician, and a social activist. Born in 1904 in Kraków, he was murdered by the Communist secret services in 1949, in the notorious Mokotów Prison in Warsaw.

Doboszyński was born in Kraków on 11 January 1904, in a noble family. His father Adam was a lawyer and a member of the Austrian Imperial Council. During the Polish-Soviet War, sixteen-year old Doboszyński volunteered to the 6th Regiment of Heavy Artillery in Kraków, serving for four months.

The series, which premiered on 28 September 2015 on SVT1 and was broadcast on ITV Encore in the UK from 31 August 2016, follows Vera Fors (Mia Skäringer), an ordinary mother-of-two whose life is turned upside down by a tragic event. After her husband has an affair with another woman, Vera loses the job that her husband got her, and desperately seeking new employment, she responds to a job vacancy in Ängelby, a small remote suburban city.

As Vera seeks the opportunity to start a new life, she makes the decision to take the children and move to Ängelby. But on the way, tragedy strikes when Vera appears to hit and kill a teenage ice-hockey star.

"The 2017 Six Nations Championship was the 18th series of the Six Nations Championship, the annual northern hemisphere rugby union championship. The tournament was also known as the RBS 6 Nations because of the tournament's sponsorship by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.

It was contested by defending champions England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Including the competition's previous iterations as the Home Nations Championship and Five Nations Championship, it was the 123rd edition of the tournament.

For the first time the 2017 tournament used the bonus point system common to most other professional rugby union tournaments. As well as the standard four points for a win and two for a draw, a team scoring four tries in a match received an additional league table point, as did a team losing by seven or fewer points. Additionally, to ensure that a team winning all of its five matches (a Grand Slam) would also win the Championship, three bonus points were to be awarded for this achievement.
For the second successive year, the championship was won by England with a round to spare.
However, they were denied the Grand Slam and Triple Crown in the final game by a defeat to Ireland in the final round, the fifth time this has happened to England in the Six Nations era (2000, 2001, 2011, 2013 and 2017) and the third time at the hands of the Irish (the other two being 2001 and 2011).","user

"The Cadillac Series 65, after the Series 60, represented Cadillac's second, and, being built on the C-body instead of the B-body, somewhat physically larger entry into the mid-priced vehicle market when it appeared in 1937. It was slightly higher in status than the LaSalle, also offered by Cadillac.

In 1937 it was offered in only one body style, a 4-door 5-seat sedan, built by Fisher on the same wheelbase as used by the Cadillac Series 70 and the Buick Roadmaster. The car offered a longer heavier car than the Series 60 at a price below that of the Fleetwood bodied Series 70.

Under the hood was the Monobloc V8. The only displacement that was available was the . This engine produced 135 hp (101 kW) at 3400 R.P.M. The car had Bendix dual-servo brakes, ""Knee-Action"" independent suspension in front and a Stromberg carburetor ('37: AA-25; '38: AAV-25) with an electric choke.

In 1938 the Series 65 and the Series 75 shared a new front end style featuring a massive vertical cellular grille, three sets of horizontal bars on the hood sides, alligator hood, and headlights on the filler space between the fenders and the hood. Optional sidemount covers were hinged to the fenders. Quarter windows were of sliding rather than hinged construction. The rear of the body had rounder corners and more smoothly blended lines. Trunks had more of an appearance of being an integral part of the body. Bodies were all steel except for wooden main sills.

    The Cadillac Series 65, after the Series 60, represented Cadillac's second, and, being built on the C-body instead of the B-body, somewhat physically larger entry into the mid-priced vehicle market when it appeared in 1937. It was slightly higher in status than the LaSalle, also offered by Cadillac.

In 1937 it was offered in only one body style, a 4-door 5-seat sedan, built by Fisher on the same wheelbase as used by the Cadillac Series 70 and the Buick Roadmaster. The car offered a longer heavier car than the Series 60 at a price below that of the Fleetwood bodied Series 70.

Under the hood was the Monobloc V8. The only displacement that was available was the . This engine produced 135 hp (101 kW) at 3400 R.P.M. The car had Bendix dual-servo brakes, ""Knee-Action"" independent suspension in front and a Stromberg carburetor ('37: AA-25; '38: AAV-25) with an electric choke.

In 1938 the Series 65 and the Series 75 shared a new front end style featuring a massive vertical cellular grille, three sets of horizontal bars on the hood sides, alligator hood, and headlights on the filler space between the fenders and the hood. Optional sidemount covers were hinged to the fenders. Quarter windows were of sliding rather than hinged construction. The rear of the body had rounder corners and more smoothly blended lines. Trunks had more of an appearance of being an integral part of the body. Bodies were all steel except for wooden main sills. New chassis details included a column gear shift, horns just behind the grille, battery under the right hand side of the hood, transverse muffler just behind the fuel tank, wheels by a different manufacturer, ""Synchro-Flex"" flywheel, hypoid rear axle and the deletion of the oil filter.

"Stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ""STIM2"" gene.

This gene is a member of the stromal interaction molecule (STIM) family which comprises only two members together with its homologue STIM1, and likely arose from a common ancestral gene. They encode type 1 transmembrane proteins that are located in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR / ER) into the cell. Alternative translation initiation from an AUG and a non-AUG (UUG) start site results in the production of two different STIM2 isoforms.

Both members of the STIM family were identified in 2005 as free-calcium (Ca2+) sensors which participate in a mechanism of Ca2+ entry into the cell referred to as store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Many cellular processes and signaling pathways are started by previous release of Ca2+ stored in subcellular organelles, which needs of a continuous refilling. SOCE is considered the mechanism of store refilling and an essential mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in non-electrically excitable cells. While STIM1 triggers SOCE, research on STIM2 function suggests a major role as feedback regulator that stabilizes basal cytosolic and S/ER Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]. STIM2 detects small decreases in Ca2+ content stored in the S/ER, switches to the activated state and interacts with so called store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels located in the plasma membrane, such as Orai or TRPC channels, allowing SOCE. Although the functional role of STIM2 has been elusive for many years, studies performed in 2009-2010 on murine models suggested that STIM2 participates in processes of the development and functioning of many cell types, including smooth muscle myoblasts, cells of the immune system and neurons, and is involved in tumorigenesis, the development of autoimmune diseases and mechanisms of neuronal damage after transient ischemic conditions.","user

"Bygrave is a village and civil parish in the North Hertfordshire district of Hertfordshire, England, about 2 miles north-east of Baldock. In the 10th century the parish was called Bigraffan and 11th to 16th centuries Bigrave. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 271. A reservoir is situated behind the Old Rectory and used for irrigation of potato crops by Manor Farm.

The village stands on a clay-capped hill, a defensive position where the original settlement was surrounded by moats built in 1386 which can still be seen today. From these defences, the whole parish bounded by Icknield Way, the Great North Road, the Cat Ditch and a ridge to the north would have been visible.

The village church is St Margaret's and is dedicated to St Margaret of Antioch, while the site on which it stands dates from at least Saxon times with two phases of Saxon construction from 8th-10th centuries. Some Romano-British pottery, pre-dating the present church by several centuries was found under the north nave wall indicating a much earlier settlement on this site. This church has carvings of the ancient game of Nine Men Morris on the frames of the chancel windows. There are wall paintings that date from the mid fifteenth century. A notable rector here was George Coke who went on to be the bishop of Hereford. The Church is open at weekends only and the key is available from the churchwardens.

The peaceful lane leading to the church was once the centre of a busy village and known as the Market Place and flourished between the 13th and 15th centuries. There was a 3-day annual fair beginning at the feast of St Margaret. The date was changed to Easter Monday and survived until Victorian days.

The Manor Farm has contributed much to the life of this village, from when most people living there were actually employed on the farm, to the present day. Sheep are still grazed on the Common.

There is also a tiny airfield used for microlight aircraft.","user

"Spaceway-2 is part of AT&T's constellation of direct broadcast satellites. The satellite was launched via an Arianespace Ariane 5 ECA rocket from Kourou, French Guiana on 16 November 2005. Its operational position is in geosynchronous orbit above the equator at 99.2° West longitude. Spaceway-2 is a Boeing 702-model satellite with a 12-year life expectancy. It is expected to support high-definition television to DirecTV customers with its Ka-band communications payload. Although Spaceway-2 was originally built by Boeing to be used for broadband Internet access via Hughes Network Systems, it has been retrofitted to deliver HD local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox) to numerous markets nationwide.

On 19 April 2006, the satellite was delivered to DirecTV's control after successful on-orbit testing. Spaceway-2 immediately started broadcasting HD locals to DirecTV customers in eight more markets: Minneapolis, Minnesota; Sacramento and San Diego, California; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Nashville, Tennessee; Kansas City, Missouri; Columbus, Ohio; and Birmingham, Alabama. Satellites named T10 (launched in 2007) and T11 (launched in 2008), constructed by Boeing, also for use in high-definition television, are bent-pipe Ka-band satellites instead of regenerative satellites, and are being used to continue the expansion of DirecTV's HD services.

Spaceway-2 was originally envisioned as a global Ka-band communications system.

Boeing retrofitted the Spaceway-2 satellite for bent-pipe Ka-band communications for use in high-definition television and disabled the regenerative on-board processing of the original system that was to be used for the Spaceway broadband satellite communications.

T11 is co-located with Spaceway-2 satellites in order to use the 500 MHz of unused spectrum for HDTV broadcasting. This spectrum was originally intended for the broadband internet capabilities of the two Spaceway satellites which were disabled by Hughes Network Systems at the request of DirecTV.","user

Many domestic tourists come from nearby Barcelona, while the international tourists come from a whole range of countries, especially the Netherlands, England, France, and more recently the United States.

Llafranc is within easy walking distance of other, similar towns, such as Calella de Palafrugell.

The ""Hotel Llafranc"" dominates the main sea promenade and was popular with artists such as Salvador Dalí and Ernest Hemingway. The English writer Tom Sharpe was also a resident of Llafranc.

El Far is the most popular residence in Llafranc, located 1.5 km north of the beach on a steep hill overlooking the beach and town. El Far has a lighthouse, hotel and large development with communal pool.

Stablished in 1957, Kim's Camping is another celebrated tourist accommodation in Llafranc, being recorded within first 20 campsites in Spain and increasingly popular for domestic tourism and visitors from France, UK, the Netherlands and Belgium.

"Idris Barzani (1944 – January 31, 1987) was a Kurdish politician in Iraq. He was the brother of Massoud Barzani, the president of the KRG, and the father of Nechervan Idris Barzani. He was often on diplomatic trips for the KDP. He died on January 31, 1987, of a heart attack, aged 43.

Idris Barzani was one of the most prominent political figures in Kurdish politics, spending his entire life serving the Kurdish cause alongside his father Mullah Mustafa and brother Massoud Barzani. Barzani was known to be the peacemaker figure among the Kurdish parties after the 1975 Algiers Agreement between Shah Pahlavi and Saddam Hussein which led to the Collapse of the Peace Accord.

"Human rights in Kyrgyzstan improved after the ouster of President Askar Akayev in the 2005 Tulip Revolution and the installment of a more democratic government under Roza Otunbayeva.

Formerly a republic of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan became independent in 1991.

In 2020 the country is considered ""partly free"" by Freedom House with a score of 39 out of 100.

"Bomberman Legends, also known as Jaguar Bomberman, is an unreleased action-maze video game that was in development by Genetic Fantasia and planned to be published by Atari Corporation for the Atari Jaguar. It was going to be a unique entry in the ""Bomberman"" franchise, featuring its own dedicated single-player and multiplayer modes, with the latter having support for up to eight players by using two Team Tap adapters.

The idea of creating a ""Bomberman"" title for the Jaguar was primarily hatched by Genetic Fantasia, which was a development company that was formed by Mike Mika, along with his colleagues to Atari Corp. during a behind-the-scenes meeting at Las Vegas in 1994, with the team looking at ""Super Bomberman 2"" in order to replicate its gameplay mechanics on the system.

Though Atari acquired the license of ""Bomberman"" from Hudson Soft between 1994 and 1995, the project would be discontinued by the former sometime in 1996 along with other upcoming projects for the platform such as ""Black ICE\White Noise"" and ""Thea Realm Fighters"", due to Atari preparing to drop support for the Jaguar before merging with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on April of the same year. ""Bomberman Legends"" was never previewed or mentioned in magazines and other publications at the time when the title was still being developed, until its existence was revealed during an online Q&A session hosted by ""Next Generation"" on April 1998. The game was also thought to be lost, before its source code was eventually recovered in recent years by two of the original programmers of the title.","user

"Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five was an American hip hop group formed in the South Bronx of New York City in 1978. The group's members were Grandmaster Flash, Melle Mel, The Kidd Creole (not to be confused with Kid Creole), Keef Cowboy, Scorpio and Rahiem. The group's use of turntablism, breakbeat DJing, and conscious lyricism were significant in the early development of hip hop music.

In the late 1970s, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five built their reputation and achieved local success by performing at parties and live shows. By 1980, the group had signed with Sugar Hill Records. Under Sugar Hill Records, the group rose to prominence in the early 1980s with their first hit ""Freedom"". It was not until the release of the song ""The Message"" in 1982 and the album of the same name that they achieved mainstream success. The song provided a political and social commentary and went on to become a driving force behind conscious hip-hop.

Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five split into two separate groups, due to differences, until a brief reunion in 1987 led to the release of the original line-up's second album ""On the Strength"". Afterwards, they disbanded permanently. Today, the group's legacy continues as Grandmaster's Furious Five with only Melle Mel and Scorpio as remaining members.

The group are widely regarded as one of the greatest groups of all time. They were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2007; the first hip hop group to be inducted. In 2002, its first year of archival, ""The Message"" was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.

"Fikret Mashadi Jamil oghlu Amirov (; November 22, 1922, Ganja – February 20, 1984, Baku) was a prominent Azerbaijani composer of the Soviet period.

Fikret Amirov grew up in an atmosphere of Azerbaijani folk music. His father, Mashadi Jamil Amirov, was a famous mugam singer (""xanəndə""), who played tar and composed, including the 1915 opera ""Seyfal mulk"".

During his childhood and early adolescence, Fikret began composing pieces for the piano. Upon his graduation from the Ganja Music College, Amirov entered the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire, now known as the Baku Music Academy, where he was a student of Boris Zeidman and Uzeyir Hajibeyov.

In 1941, when Nazi Germany attacked the USSR, Amirov, 19 at the time, was drafted to the Soviet army. He was wounded near Voronezh, hospitalized and demobilized from the military service, returning to Baku to continue his studies at the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire.

Amirov's music was strongly influenced by Azeri folk melodies. He created a new genre called symphonic mugam. Amirov's symphonic mugams were based on classical folk pieces and were performed by many renowned symphony orchestras throughout the world, such as the Houston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski.

Amirov was a prolific composer. His most famous pieces include symphonic works such as ""Shur"" (1946), ""Kurd Ovshari"" (1949), ""Azerbaijan Capriccio"" (1961), ""Gulustan Bayati-Shiraz"" (1968), ""The Legend of Nasimi"" (1977), ""To the Memory of the Heroes of the Great National War"" (1944), ""Double Concerto for Violin, Piano and Orchestra"" (1948) etc.

His ballets include ""Nizami"" (1947) and ""Arabian Nights"", which premiered in 1979. Amirov wrote the opera ""Sevil"" in 1953.

He also wrote a number of pieces for the piano including ""Ballad,"" ""Ashug's Song,"" ""Nocturne,"" ""Humoreska,"" ""Lyrical Dance,"" ""Waltz,"" ""Lullaby"" and ""Toccata."" He also wrote numerous film scores.

    The Belarusian Premier League or the Vyšejšaja Liha or the Vysheyshaya Liga (, , ""Top League"") is the top division of professional football in Belarus, and is organized by the Belarusian Football Federation. The number of teams in the competition has varied over the years from as high as 17 (1992–93 season) to as low as 11 (2012). As of 2016, the league includes 16 teams. Each team plays every other team twice during the course of the season. At the end of the season, the two teams with the fewest points are automatically relegated to the Belarusian First League, while the third worst team plays a promotion-relegation playoff against the third best team from the second tier. The top two teams from the Belarusian First League automatically win promotion to the Premier League. Shakhtyor Soligorsk are the current champions, after winning their second championship title in 2020.

Tête-à-la-Baleine, occasionally known as Whale Head in English, was settled in the 19th century after Michael Kenty bought the local trading post from the Labrador Company. Initial settlement mostly took place on the nearby islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, although eventually most residents moved to the community's current site on the mainland in order to be closer to sources of wood and food in the winter. However, some residents still move back and forth, residing on the islands in summer and in the mainland community in winter.

"Outer space is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is . The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins. Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is ""dark energy"", a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.

Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. The Kármán line, an altitude of above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.

Humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high-altitude balloon flights. This was followed by crewed rocket flights and, then, crewed Earth orbit, first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961. Due to the high cost of getting into space, human spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon. On the other hand, uncrewed spacecraft have reached all of the known planets in the Solar System.

Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and radiation. Microgravity also has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.","user

"The Battle of Naseby took place on 14 June 1645 during the First English Civil War, near the village of Naseby in Northamptonshire. The Parliamentarian New Model Army, commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, destroyed the main Royalist army under Charles I and Prince Rupert. Defeat ended any real hope of Royalist victory, although Charles did not finally surrender until May 1646. 

The 1645 campaign began in April when the newly formed New Model Army marched west to relieve Taunton, before being ordered back to lay siege to Oxford, the Royalist wartime capital. On 31 May, the Royalists stormed Leicester and Fairfax was instructed to abandon the siege and engage them. Although heavily outnumbered, Charles decided to stand and fight and after several hours of combat his force was effectively destroyed. The Royalists suffered over 1,000 casualties, with over 4,500 of their infantry captured and paraded through the streets of London; they would never again field an army of comparable quality.

They also lost all their artillery and stores, along with Charles' personal baggage and private papers, which revealed his attempts to bring the Irish Catholic Confederation and foreign mercenaries into the war. These were published in a pamphlet titled ""The King's Cabinet Opened"", whose appearance was a great boost to the cause of Parliament.","user

"STS-2 was the second Space Shuttle mission conducted by NASA, and the second flight of the orbiter ""Columbia"". The mission launched on 12 November 1981 and landed two days later on 14 November. STS-2 marked the first time that a crewed, reusable orbital vehicle returned to space. This mission tested the Shuttle Imaging Radar as part of the OSTA-1 payload, along with a wide range of other experiments including the Shuttle robotic arm, commonly known as Canadarm. Other experiments or tests included Shuttle Multispectral Infrared Radiometer, Feature Identification and Location Experiment, Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites, Ocean Color Experiment, Night/Day optical Survey of Lightning, Heflex Bioengineering Test, and Aerodynamic Coefficient Identification Package (ACIP). One of the feats accomplished was various tests on the OMS including starting and restarting the engines while in orbit and various adjustments to its orbit. The OMS tests also help adjust the Shuttle's orbit for use of the radar. During the mission, President Reagan called the crew of STS-2 from Mission Control in Houston.

In the early planning stages of the Space Shuttle program, STS-2 was intended to be a reboost mission for the aging Skylab space station. However, such a mission was impeded by delays with the Shuttle's development and the deteriorating orbit of Skylab. Skylab ultimately de-orbited on 11 July 1979, two years before the launch of STS-2.","user

The word ""Mohawk"" is an exonym. In the Mohawk language, the people say that they are from ""Kanienʼkehá꞉ka"" or ""Flint Stone Place"" or ""People of the Flint Nation"".

The Mohawks were extremely wealthy traders, as other nations in their confederacy needed their flint for tool-making.

The Dutch heard and wrote that as ""Mohawks"" and so the People of Kan-ee-en Ka are often referred to as ""Mohawks"". The Dutch also referred to the Mohawk as ""Egils"" or ""Maquas"". The French adapted those terms as ""Aigniers"" or ""Maquis"", or called them by the generic ""Iroquois"".","user

The word ""Mohawk"" is an exonym. In the Mohawk language, the people say that they are from ""Kanienʼkehá꞉ka"" or ""Flint Stone Place"" or ""People of the Flint Nation"".

The Mohawks were extremely wealthy traders, as other nations in their confederacy needed their flint for tool-making. Their Algonquian-speaking neighbors (and competitors), the People of ""Muh-heck Heek Ing"" (""food-area place""), a people called by the Dutch ""Mohicans"" or ""Mahicans"", called the People of Ka-nee-en Ka ""Maw Unk Lin"" or ""Bear People"". The Dutch heard and wrote that as ""Mohawks"" and so the People of Kan-ee-en Ka are often referred to as ""Mohawks"". The Dutch also referred to the Mohawk as ""Egils"" or ""Maquas"". The French adapted those terms as ""Aigniers"" or ""Maquis"", or called them by the generic ""Iroquois"".

His first appearance as a main character is found in Chrétien de Troyes' poem ""Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart"", written in the 12th century. Later, his character was expanded upon in other works of Arthurian romance, especially the vast ""Lancelot-Grail"" prose cycle that presented the now-familiar version of his legend following its retelling in ""Le Morte d'Arthur"".

"The Portage Lakes are a group of glacial kettle lakes and reservoirs in Northeast Ohio. The name comes from an old Indian portage path that connected the Cuyahoga River flowing north to Lake Erie and the Tuscarawas River, a tributary of the Muskingum River, which flows south to the Ohio River. This proved advantageous for the Indians and early settlers as navigation from Lake Erie to the Ohio was possible with only an eight-mile portage.

    The Portage Lakes are a group of glacial kettle lakes and reservoirs in Northeast Ohio. The name comes from an old Indian portage path that connected the Cuyahoga River flowing north to Lake Erie and the Tuscarawas River, a tributary of the Muskingum River, which flows south to the Ohio River. This proved advantageous for the Indians and early settlers as navigation from Lake Erie to the Ohio was possible with only an eight-mile portage.

"Queso flameado (Spanish for ""flamed cheese""; also queso fundido, ""melted cheese"" or choriqueso) is a dish of hot melted cheese and spicy chorizo that is often served flambé. Often compared to cheese fondue, it is a party dish; it is popular at cookouts and in restaurants as an appetizer. Almost unique in Mexican cuisine, in the cuisine of the United States this dish has been widely adapted and is considered a native dish in El Paso. In Mexico, it occurs in restaurants more often in the north.
Typical main ingredients are melted cheese and a characteristic meat sauce of loose fresh chorizo, tomato, onion, chile and spices. It is served in a small, shallow casserole or other ceramic or metal heat-proof baking dish. The cheese and sauce are prepared separately, and combined just before serving. This may be done at the table, especially if finished with a flambé: high alcohol liquor is poured on the cheese and ignited, and as it burns the server folds in the sauce. If not flambéed, the mixture may be quickly broiled. Either way, the finished dish is presented while it is still bubbling hot, and it is spooned onto small soft tortillas for individual servings.

""Queso flameado"" is said to originate in the borderlands of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, as a campfire dish.
In Tex-Mex restaurants, this dish is sometimes confused or conflated with chili con queso, a cheese sauce served with tortilla chips for dipping. The term ""queso fundido"" also refers to processed cheese and is defined as such in the Spanish version of Codex Alimentarius.","user

"The Paradise Club is a BBC television crime drama series, broadcast between 19 September 1989 and 27 November 1990. The series starred Don Henderson and Leslie Grantham as Frank and Danny Kane, siblings who inherit a nightclub from their mother, Ma Kane, a matriarch of a criminal South London gang, after she tragically dies. At the start of the series, Frank is working as a priest but decides to return to London to steer his brother Danny away from crime. The series featured a large supporting cast, with Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden notably making an appearance in the episode ""Rock and Roll Roulette"". A total of 20 episodes were broadcast over the course of 2 series.

The series has never officially been released on DVD, due to issues surrounding clearance rights for the music used. Notably, the series has yet to be repeated on any of the BBC's co-owned free-to-air digital channels, such as UK Gold or UKTV Drama (it has been aired on UK Gold). However, both series are available to purchase from Amazon, but these are VHS to DVD transfers of the original broadcast, in varying quality. A soundtrack album of music featured in the series was also released in 1989, and was available on CD, LP and Cassette.","user

They introduced gameplay improvements in terms of artificial intelligence and physics as well as new mode such as the World Cup of Hockey tournament mode and a revamped version of ""Be a GM"", a simulation mode where the player acts as a team's general manager, titled ""Franchise Mode"", which now features team owners and team relocation. A newer Creation Zone was also added, featuring an expansive team builder as well as an arena creator. Modes from its predecessor saw a return as well, including the trading card-based team building mode Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT), the online co-operative play mode known as EA Sports Hockey League, and Be a Pro, a career mode. Similar to the past two ""NHL"" titles, ""NHL 17"" features presentation in the style of the ""NHL on NBC"".

"""Hated in the Nation"" is the sixth and final episode in the third series of the British science fiction anthology series ""Black Mirror"". Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by James Hawes, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, along with the rest of series three. It is the longest episode of ""Black Mirror"", at 89 minutes.

A Nordic noir-inspired episode, ""Hated in the Nation"" follows Detectives Karin Parke (Kelly Macdonald) and Blue Coulson (Faye Marsay) as they investigate a spate of deaths targeting the subjects of social media hatred, at the hands of Autonomous Drone Insects (ADIs) that have been deployed to combat environmental catastrophe as bees near extinction. It was filmed largely in London.

Informed by Brooker's experience of receiving hate mail after writing a 2004 ""Guardian"" column that disparaged George W. Bush, the episode drew comparison to ""The X-Files"" and explored themes including government surveillance and environmentalism. Across mostly positive reviews, critics praised the acting but gave mixed comments on the story and episode's length. It received middling rankings on ""Black Mirror"" instalments by quality.","user

"Badwater Basin is an endorheic basin in Death Valley National Park, Death Valley, Inyo County, California, noted as the lowest point in North America and the United States, with a depth of below sea level.

"The Ural owl (""Strix uralensis"") is a large nocturnal owl. It is a member of the true owl family, ""Strigidae"". The Ural owl is a member of the genus ""Strix"", that is also the origin of the family’s name under Linnaean taxonomy. Both its common name and scientific name refer to the Ural Mountains of Russia where the type specimen was collected. However, this species has an extremely broad distribution that extends as far west as much of Scandinavia, montane eastern Europe, and, sporadically, central Europe, thence sweeping across the Palearctic broadly through Russia to as far east as Sakhalin and throughout Japan. The Ural owl may include up to 15 subspecies, but most likely the number may be slightly fewer if accounting for clinal variations. 

This forest owl is typical associated with the vast taiga forest in Eurosiberia, although it ranges to other forest types, including mixed forests and temperate deciduous forest. The Ural owl is something of a dietary generalist like many members of the ""Strix"" genus, but it is usually locally reliant on small mammals, especially small rodents such as voles. In terms of its reproductive habits, Ural owls tend to vigorously protect a set territory on which they have historically nested on a variety of natural nest sites, including tree cavities and stumps and nests originally built by other birds but now, in many parts of the range are adapted to nest boxes made by biologists and conservationists. Breeding success is often strongly correlated with prey populations. The Ural owl is considered to be a stable bird species overall, with a conservation status per the IUCN as a least concern species. Despite some local decreases and extinctions, the Ural owl has been aided in central Europe by reintroductions.","user

"Shenzhou 4 () – launched on December 29, 2002 – was the fourth uncrewed launch of the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. Two dummy astronauts were used to test the life support systems (a live astronaut was not used until Shenzhou 5 on October 15, 2003).

The spacecraft was equipped for a crewed flight, even featuring a sleeping bag, food, and medication. The windows were constructed of a new material that was designed to stay clear even after reentry to allow an astronaut to confirm that the parachutes have deployed properly. It was said that the spacecraft flown on Shenzhou 4 had no major differences to that used on Shenzhou 5. It flew with the ability for manual control and emergency landing, systems needed for a crewed flight. A week before the launch, astronauts trained in the spacecraft to familiarise themselves with its systems.

Initially the spacecraft was in a by orbit inclined at 42.4°. This was raised to by at 23:35 UTC on December 29, 2002. On January 4 and January 5, 2003 several smaller manoeuvres were thought to have taken place. The rate of orbital decay seemed higher after January 1, suggesting that the orbital module's solar panels may have been deployed for the first time. Compared to Shenzhou 3 the orbital period of Shenzhou 4 was much more tightly bounded with smaller manoeuvres.

The launch of Shenzhou 4 was watched by officials including Chairman of the National People's Congress Li Peng; Vice Premier and member of the Politburo Standing Committee Wu Bangguo; Jia Qinglin, also a member of the Standing Committee; Cao Gangchuan, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission; Song Jian, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; and Li Jinai, head of the General Armament Department of the People's Liberation Army. According to the weather forecast, the launch site was -29°C.

The spacecraft carried 100 peony seeds to investigate the effect of weightlessness on plants grown from them. The 52 experiments onboard investigated areas in physics, biology, medicine, earth observation, material science, and astronomy.

Four tracking ships were used for the mission — one off the coast of South Africa in the South Atlantic Ocean, one in the Indian Ocean near Western Australia, one in the North Pacific Ocean south of Japan, and one in the South Pacific Ocean west of New Zealand.

The reentry module landed safely about from Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. As with previous flights, the command for reentry to begin was given by a tracking ship off the coast of South Africa. It was thought before the flight that the Chinese would attempt a water landing to test the emergency system but this did not happen. The orbital module remained in orbit until September 9, 2003.","user

    Shenzhou 4 () – launched on December 29, 2002 – was the fourth uncrewed launch of the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. Two dummy astronauts were used to test the life support systems (a live astronaut was not used until Shenzhou 5 on October 15, 2003).

The spacecraft was equipped for a crewed flight, even featuring a sleeping bag, food, and medication. The windows were constructed of a new material that was designed to stay clear even after reentry to allow an astronaut to confirm that the parachutes have deployed properly. It was said that the spacecraft flown on Shenzhou 4 had no major differences to that used on Shenzhou 5. It flew with the ability for manual control and emergency landing, systems needed for a crewed flight.

"Edgar Karl Alfons Ende (23 February 1901 – 27 December 1965) was a German surrealist painter and father of the children's novelist Michael Ende.

Ende attended the Altona School of Arts and Crafts from 1916 to 1920. In 1922 he married Gertrude Strunck, but divorced four years later. He remarried in 1929, the same year his son Michael was born. In the 1930s Ende's Surrealist paintings began to attract considerable critical attention, but were then condemned as degenerate by the Nazi government. Beginning in 1936 the Nazis forbade him to continue to paint or exhibit his work. In 1940 he was conscripted into the Luftwaffe as an operator of anti-aircraft artillery.

The majority of his paintings were destroyed by a bomb raid on Munich in 1944, making his surviving pre-war work extremely rare. In 1951, Ende met the recognized founder of Surrealism, André Breton, who admired his work and declared him an official Surrealist. He continued to paint surrealist works until his death in 1965 of a myocardial infarction.

Ende's paintings are thought to have had a significant influence on his son's writing. This is inferred in the scenes depicting the surreal dream-paintings from Yor's Minroud in ""Die Unendliche Geschichte"" (""The Neverending Story""), and is made explicit in Michael Ende's book ""Der Spiegel im Spiegel"" (""The mirror in the mirror""), a collection of short stories based on (and printed alongside) Edgar Ende's surrealist works.","user

"In combinatorics, the Dinitz theorem (formerly known as Dinitz conjecture) is a statement about the extension of arrays to partial Latin squares, proposed in 1979 by Jeff Dinitz, and proved in 1994 by Fred Galvin.

The Dinitz theorem is that given an ""n"" × ""n"" square array, a set of ""m"" symbols with ""m"" ≥ ""n"", and for each cell of the array an ""n""-element set drawn from the pool of ""m"" symbols, it is possible to choose a way of labeling each cell with one of those elements in such a way that no row or column repeats a symbol.
It can also be formulated as a result in graph theory, that the list chromatic index of the complete bipartite graph formula_1 equals formula_2. That is, if each edge of the complete bipartite graph is assigned a set of formula_2 colors, it is possible to choose one of the assigned colors for each edge
such that no two edges incident to the same vertex have the same color.

Galvin's proof generalizes to the statement that, for every bipartite multigraph, the list chromatic index equals its chromatic index. The more general edge list coloring conjecture states that the same holds not only for bipartite graphs, but also for any loopless multigraph. An even more general conjecture states that the list chromatic number of claw-free graphs always equals their chromatic number. The Dinitz theorem is also related to Rota's basis conjecture.","user

"St Mark's Campanile () is the bell tower of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Italy. The current campanile is a reconstruction completed in 1912, the historical tower having collapsed in 1902. At in height, it is the tallest structure in Venice and is colloquially termed ""el paròn de casa"" (the master of the house). It is one of the most recognizable symbols of the city.

Located in Saint Mark's Square near the mouth of the Grand Canal, the campanile was initially intended as a watchtower to sight approaching ships and protect the entry to the city. It also served as a landmark to guide Venetian ships safely into harbour. Construction began in the early tenth century and continued sporadically over time as the tower was slowly raised in height. A belfry and a spire were first added in the twelfth century. In the fourteenth century the spire was gilded, making the tower visible to distant ships in the Adriatic. The campanile reached its full height in 1514 when the belfry and spire were completely rebuilt on the basis of an earlier Renaissance design by Giorgio Spavento. Historically, the bells served to regulate the civic and religious life of Venice, marking the beginning, pauses, and end of the work day; the convocation of government assemblies; and public executions.

The campanile stands alone in the square, near the front of St Mark's Basilica. It has a simple form, recalling its early defensive function, the bulk of which is a square brick shaft with lesenes, wide on each side and tall. The belfry is topped by an attic with effigies of the Lion of St Mark and allegorical figures of Venice as Justice. The tower is capped by a pyramidal spire at the top of which there is a golden weather vane in the form of the archangel Gabriel.","user

"John Bryson Chane (born May 13, 1944) is a bishop of the Episcopal Church. The eighth diocesan bishop of Washington, he was consecrated at Washington National Cathedral on June 1, 2002, leading the Episcopal Diocese of Washington until he retired in November 2011. During this time, he also served between June 2003 and April 2005 as interim dean of Washington National Cathedral. In his role as Episcopal Bishop of Washington, Chane served as president and CEO of the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation, which oversees the operations of Washington National Cathedral and the three cathedral schools: St. Alban's School for Boys, the National Cathedral School for Girls, and Beauvoir, the National Cathedral Elementary School.

""Washingtonian Magazine"" named him as one of the 150 most influential leaders in the District of Columbia. The ""Sunday Telegraph"" in London called him one of the most prominent leaders in the Anglican Communion.

A leader in global interfaith dialogue and study, Chane traveled to Iran on numerous occasions as the invited guest of former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. In late 2011, he was part of a four-person delegation that traveled to Tehran, and was instrumental in freeing the American hikers held in Evin Prison. He is one of the few from the West who has ever met with the current Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khameni.

Chane has participated as a presenter at conferences in Oslo and Tehran sponsored by the Oslo Center for Peace and Human Rights, the ""Club de Madrid"", and ""Le Dialogue des Civilizations"", focusing on religion, politics and terrorism, religion and politics and gender equality. He continues to work with the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., as a planner and presenter at the annual U.S. Islamic World Forum, held in Doha, Qatar.

He has spoken on numerous occasions at the Industrial College of The Armed Forces in Washington D.C., the U.S. Secretary of State's Open Forum and as the Anglican principal at the semi-annual Christian-Muslim Summit sponsored by Washington National Cathedral. A respected speaker and charismatic preacher, he has been invited on several occasions by the Chautauqua Institution of New York to serve as Preacher in Residence.

Chane has been the recipient of various awards, including D.C.'s Interfaith Bridge Builders Award, the George Washington University President's Medal, the Berea College Founder's Medal, Search for Common Ground's Award for Global Peace and Reconciliation, the Rumi Forum's Global Peace Award and the Yale Divinity School's Lux et Veritas Award. He was a contributing author to ""Iraq Uncensored"", an initiative of the bipartisan American Security Project,

On January 30, 2010, Chane announced his intention to retire as Episcopal Bishop of Washington, stepping down from that role in 2011. The ninth bishop, Mariann Edgar Budde, was consecrated and installed at Washington National Cathedral on November 12, 2011.","user

"Something/Anything? is the third album by American musician Todd Rundgren, released in February 1972. It was his first double album, and was recorded in late 1971 in Los Angeles, New York City and Bearsville Studios, Woodstock. Three quarters of the album was recorded in the studio with Rundgren playing all instruments and singing all vocals, as well as being the producer. The final quarter contained a number of tracks recorded live in the studio without any overdubs, save for a short snippet of archive recordings from the 1960s.

Rundgren had become confident enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards that he had tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles in an attempt to record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.

The album peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold three years after its release. A single taken from the album, ""Hello It's Me"", was a top-five hit in the US in late 1972, and it contained a further hit, ""I Saw the Light"". ""Something/Anything?"" later attracted critical acclaim as one of the most significant records of the 1970s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 173 on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and later ranked at number 396 in the 2020 edition.
It was voted number 797 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's ""All Time Top 1000 Albums"" (2000). After ""Something/Anything"", Rundgren moved away from the straightforward pop ballads present on this album to more experimental territory and progressive rock in later releases, beginning with ""A Wizard, A True Star"".","user

"Richard Rapier Stokes, (27 January 1897 – 3 August 1957) was a British soldier and Labour politician who served briefly as Lord Privy Seal in 1951.

The second son of Philip Folliott Stokes and his wife Mary Fenwick Rapier, the only surviving child of Richard Christopher Rapier (1836-1897) of Ransomes & Rapier, Richard Stokes was educated at Downside School, the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and Trinity College, Cambridge. He served in the Royal Artillery during World War I, winning the Military Cross and bar and the Croix de Guerre. His uncle Sir Wilfred Stokes, chairman and managing director of the engineering firm Ransomes & Rapier invented the Stokes Mortar in World War I. His uncle Leonard Stokes was an architect who designed the new buildings at Downside School (built 1912, when Richard was at Downside). Richard Stokes was chairman (1939) and supporter of the School of Economic Science.

On going down from Cambridge he joined his family's business, Ransomes & Rapier, and was made managing director at the age of 30. When rearmament was proposed by the National Government Stokes offered to charge the nation cost price for all his firm's rearmament work. It was rejected by the National Government and shortly afterwards he joined the Labour Party. Though he held office under Labour governments he was said to have remained a backbencher at heart.

Stokes won the Ipswich seat in a 1938 by-election, which he kept in the 1945, 1950, 1951 and 1955 elections. He was known for his independence in parliament, including, with Bishop George Bell and fellow Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Alfred Salter, opposing area strategic bombing during World War II. Stokes was also a prominent critic of the inadequacy of Allied tank design. Prior to the war, he co-wrote a paper (with Andrew MacLaren and George Lansbury) analysing the economic forces menacing peace in Europe. After the RAF's bombing of Dresden on the night of 13 February and the early hours of 14 February 1945, his questions in the House about the act were in part responsible for the reappraisal of the Government's bombing policy in the last month of the war in Europe. He raised other issues after the war relating to Yalta and the forced repatriation of Yugoslavs, and the treatment of Dr George Chatterton-Hill in Germany.

Following the 1945 general election, Labour were returned to power. Stokes devoted much of his energy to the Friends of Ireland group, of which he was treasurer. He was appointed Lord Privy Seal and the new position of Minister of Materials in April 1951, succeeding Ernest Bevin but served only a few months before Labour lost the 1951 general election. He aimed to show that the proposed armaments programme could be carried out, contrary to Aneurin Bevan and Harold Wilson (who had resigned over this and other issues).

Stokes died at home on 3 August 1957 in London of a heart attack, according to his death notice. A few days before, on 23 July, he had been in a road accident when his car overturned during a thunderstorm on the flooded London road at Stanway near Colchester.","user

"What Separates Me from You is the fourth studio album by American rock band A Day to Remember, and their third and final for Victory Records. Originally planned for release in late-October 2010, the album was delayed by a few weeks until mid-November. ""What Separates Me from You"" was released on November 15, 2010 in the UK, and on November 16 in the US.

"The IBM 1403 line printer was introduced as part of the IBM 1401 computer in 1959 and had an especially long life in the IBM product line. The original model could print 600 lines of text per minute and could skip blank lines at up to 75 inches per second (190 cm/s), while the model 3 could print at up to 1400 lines per minute. The standard model had 120 print positions. An additional 12 positions were available as an option. A print chain with up to 15 copies of the character set spun horizontally in front of the ribbon and paper. Hammers struck the paper from behind at exactly the right moment to print a character as it went by. In later models, the print chain was replaced by a print train; print slugs instead of being mounted on a chain were placed in a track.
The 1403 chain or train contained 240 characters, however numerous duplications allowed a line to be printed in less than the 0.4 s required for one full rotation. The original standard ""A"" chain contained 48 different characters, repeated five times each. A ""preferred character set"" variant used in later models printed the same 48 characters, but varied the number of appearances: 10 digits appeared eight times each, 26 upper-case letters appeared four times each, and 12 special characters codice_1 appeared eight (first four), four (middle four) or two (last four characters) times each.
Special chains or trains could be ordered for other character sets. Scientific users, for example, would use a chain that had the left parenthesis, the right parenthesis, and the plus sign in place of the per cent sign (%), the lozenge (⌑), and the ampersand (&). The numerics chain had 15 copies each of only 16 characters. The ""T"" chain for general text had two copies of 120 characters, including upper-and lower-case letters and numerous special symbols.

The ink ribbon was a long roll the width of the print area that was positioned between the print chain and the paper. The roll came in two parts, the feeder roll and take-up roll. The roll was constantly wound and rewound during printing.
Like most IBM printers of the era, the 1403 used fan-folded paper with perforated edges for tractor feeding. A carriage control tape or, later, a buffer, under program control, specified form length and the form line where printing was to begin so that paper of various sizes could be used.

An IBM 1403 printer played a cameo role in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 movie ""Dr. Strangelove"", serving as a hiding place for a portable radio.

The overstrike capability of the printer was used to generate a wide range of grey-scale equivalents. Many images were scanned, pixelated and could be reproduced on the 1403, most notably the Mona Lisa.

These were noisy machines, especially when the cover was raised. Some people were able to create text that used the timing of the print hammers to generate desired frequencies and actually play music when that text was printed.","user

"The Goulais River (Pronounced: goo-lee) is a river in northern Ontario, Canada, which rises in the Algoma highlands and empties into Goulais Bay on eastern Lake Superior near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. It is one of the largest tributaries on the eastern lake, draining an area of approximately .

The river and its tributaries were used to transport logs to local sawmills during the second half of the 19th century. The Algoma Central Railway travels up the river valley on its way to the Agawa canyon.

At one time, the river was an important spawning area for lake sturgeon. However, logging operations, fishing and the installation of an electric barrier to prevent sea lampreys from travelling upstream (removed in 1960) have reduced sturgeon activity in the river.

The river is used for recreational canoeing, kayaking, and swimming, and the headwaters and parts of the river have been protected by the Goulais River Provincial Park.

The river's name is thought to come from the French word ""goulet"" or ""narrow passage"", which is also the source of the English words ""gully"" and ""gullet"". The French called the area at the river's mouth ""Anse de la pêche"" or ""Fish Inlet"".

"Unforgotten is a British crime drama television series, which initially aired on ITV on 8 October 2015. It is written by creator Chris Lang and directed by Andy Wilson. The programme follows a team of London detectives, led by DCI Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and DI Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar), as they solve cold cases of disappearance and murder.

Each series consists of six episodes. Series 1 to 4 were broadcast in the UK in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2021 respectively. On 30 March 2021, a fifth series was announced, scheduled for release in 2022, and Sanjeev Bhaskar was confirmed to be reprising his role.

Each series deals with a new case, introducing seemingly unconnected characters who are gradually revealed to have some relationship with the victim. As the murder mystery unfolds, the emotional ramifications of the crime are also explored in the lives of those affected.

""Unforgotten"" has received critical acclaim, with Tom Courtenay winning the 2016 BAFTA TV Award for Best Supporting Actor for the first series and Mark Bonnar winning the 2017 BAFTA Scotland for Best Actor in Television for the second series.","user

Each series consists of six episodes. Series 1 to 4 were broadcast in the UK in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2021 respectively. On 30 March 2021, a fifth series was announced, scheduled for release in 2022, and Sanjeev Bhaskar was confirmed to be reprising his role.

Each series deals with a new case, introducing seemingly unconnected characters who are gradually revealed to have some relationship with the victim. As the murder mystery unfolds, the emotional ramifications of the crime are also explored in the lives of those affected.

""Unforgotten"" has received critical acclaim, with Tom Courtenay winning the 2016 BAFTA TV Award for Best Supporting Actor for the first series and Mark Bonnar winning the 2017 BAFTA Scotland for Best Actor in Television for the second series.

As the lone survivor of his family of 78 people, he later in life shared his account with historians of how he was able to survive many multiple camps of the worst concentration camps including Auschwitz, Dachau, Gross-Rosen, and the Warsaw Ghetto.

"Blaufränkisch (German for ""blue Frankish"") is a dark-skinned variety of grape used for red wine. Blaufränkisch, which is a late-ripening variety, produces red wines which are typically rich in tannin and may exhibit a pronounced spicy character.

The grape is grown across Central Europe, including Austria, Czech Republic (in particular southern Moravia where it is known as ""Frankovka""), Germany, Slovakia (where it is known as Frankovka modrá), Croatia, Serbia (""frankovka""), Slovenia (known as ""modra frankinja""), and Italy (""Franconia""). In Hungary the grape is called ""Kékfrankos"" (also lit. blue Frankish) and is grown in a number of wine regions including Sopron, Villány, Szekszárd, and Eger (where it is a major ingredient in the famous red wine blend known as ""Egri Bikavér"" (lit. Bull's Blood) having largely replaced the Kadarka grape). It has been called ""the Pinot noir of the East"" because of its spread and reputation in Eastern Europe. In America the grape is also known as Lemberger, ""Blauer Limberger"" or ""Blue Limberger"" and grown in Pennsylvania, Washington state, Michigan, New Jersey, Idaho, New York, Colorado, Ohio, Virginia. and California,<ref name=""Alpen Cellars - LEMBERGER / BLAUFRANKISH"" ></ref>

DNA profiling has shown that Blaufränkisch is a cross between Gouais blanc (Weißer Heunisch; male parent) and Blaue Zimmettraube (female parent; the offspring of Blauer Gänsfüsser). Historical sources of grapevine classification have provided very solid evidence that the geographic area of origin of the variety is Lower Styria (today Slovenian Styria). For a long time before the application of DNA analysis, Blaufränkisch was erroneously thought to be a clone of the Gamay grape variety, due to certain similarities in morphology and possibly due to its name ""Gamé"" in Bulgaria.

The German name Lemberger derives from the fact that it was imported to Germany in the 19th century from Lemberg in Lower Styria in present-day Slovenia and then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. An 1877 export of ""Lembergerreben"" to Germany has been recorded. The almost identical name Limberger refers to Limburg at Maissau in Lower Austria, where in the late 19th century ""ungrafted Limberg Blaufränkisch vines"" (""wurzelechte Limberger Blaufränkisch-Reben"") were offered for sale.","user

"David Teniers the Younger or David Teniers II (15 December 1610 – 25 April 1690) was a Flemish Baroque painter, printmaker, draughtsman, miniaturist painter, staffage painter, copyist and art curator. He was an extremely versatile artist known for his prolific output. He was an innovator in a wide range of genres such as history painting, genre painting, landscape painting, portrait and still life. He is now best remembered as the leading Flemish genre painter of his day. Teniers is particularly known for developing the peasant genre, the tavern scene, pictures of collections and scenes with alchemists and physicians.

He was court painter and the curator of the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, the art loving Governor General of the Habsburg Netherlands. He created a printed catalogue of the collections of the Archduke. He was the founder of the Antwerp Academy, where young artists were trained to draw and sculpt in the hope of reviving Flemish art after its decline following the death of the leading Flemish artists Rubens and Anthony van Dyck in the early 1640s. He influenced the next generation of Northern genre painters as well as French Rococo painters such as Antoine Watteau.","user

"""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" is a song recorded by Julie Covington for the 1976 concept album ""Evita"", later included in the 1978 musical of the same name. The song was written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were researching the life of Argentine leader Eva Perón. It appears at the opening of the first and second acts, as well as near the end of the show, initially as the spirit of the dead Eva exhorting the people of Argentina not to mourn her, during Eva's speech from the balcony of the Casa Rosada, and during her final broadcast.

The ""Evita"" album had taken 3–4 months to record, since Rice was not satisfied with the intensity of the initial recordings. The song had a number of different titles before ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" was chosen as the final one. The song shares its melody with ""Oh What a Circus"" from the same show and lyrically consists of platitudes where Eva tries to win the favour of the people of Argentina. It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 November 1976 as the first single from the album, accompanied by national and trade advertising, full-colour posters, display sleeves as well as radio interviews.

The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and earned a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), with over a million copies sold. It also reached the top of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand and the Netherlands. ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" was critically appreciated, with Rice and Lloyd Webber winning the 1977 Ivor Novello award in the category of Best Song Musically and Lyrically. When ""Evita"" moved to a London theatre, Covington—who had become disenchanted with the whole project—refused to reprise the part of Eva, and the role went to Elaine Paige. ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" has been covered by multiple artists, including The Carpenters, Olivia Newton-John, and Sinéad O'Connor as well as actors Lea Michele and Chris Colfer from the TV series ""Glee‍"".

In 1996, American singer Madonna played the title role in the film adaptation of the musical and recorded her rendition of ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"". Released as the second single from the film soundtrack on 4 February 1997, her version received positive reviews from music critics who praised her vocal performance. A separate version called the ""Miami Mix"", which included re-recorded vocals in English and Spanish and an Argentinian bandoneon, was promoted to radio. Madonna's version reached number one on the European Hot 100 Singles chart and the national charts of the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, and Spain. It also became a top-ten hit on the US ""Billboard"" Hot 100 and many other charts worldwide, while attaining gold or platinum in six countries.","user

"The Volga Delta is the largest river delta in Europe, and occurs where Europe's largest river system, the Volga River, drains into the Caspian Sea in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, north-east of the republic of Kalmykia. The delta is located in the Caspian Depression—the far eastern part of the delta lies in Kazakhstan. The delta drains into the Caspian approximately 60 km downstream from the city of Astrakhan.

The Volga Delta has grown significantly in the 20th century because of changes in the level of the Caspian Sea. In 1880, the delta had an area of 3,222 km². Today the Volga Delta covers an area of 27,224 km² and is approximately 160 km across. It has a classical ""delta pattern"". The delta lies in the arid climate zone, characterized by very little rainfall. The region receives less than one inch of rainfall in January and in July in normal years.

"Lorenzo Ramero is an Italian mathematician living in France, specialized in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. He is currently a professor of mathematics at the University of Lille.

Ramero obtained his Laurea in Matematica from the University of Pisa and his Diploma from the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in 1989. He completed his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994 under the supervision of Alexander Beilinson, with a thesis titled ""An formula_1-adic Fourier transform over local fields"".

Together with Ofer Gabber, Ramero developed the algebraic geometry based on almost rings extending earlier ideas of Gerd Faltings on ""almost mathematics"". This theory extends already classical algebraic geometry formalism of Alexander Grothendieck's school in order to treat new phenomena in p-adic Hodge theory. This work is systematized in their monograph ""Almost ring theory"".

More foundational material was developed after the first book, and especially an extended theory of perfectoid rings and perfectoid spaces which generalizes the recent work of Peter Scholze. These aspects were recapitulated in the book ""Foundations for Almost Ring Theory"".","user

Ramero obtained his Laurea in Matematica from the University of Pisa and his Diploma from the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in 1989. He completed his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994 under the supervision of Alexander Beilinson, with a thesis titled ""An formula_1-adic Fourier transform over local fields"".

Together with Ofer Gabber, Ramero developed the algebraic geometry based on almost rings extending earlier ideas of Gerd Faltings on ""almost mathematics"". This theory extends already classical algebraic geometry formalism of Alexander Grothendieck's school in order to treat new phenomena in p-adic Hodge theory. This work is systematized in their monograph ""Almost ring theory"".

More foundational material was developed after the first book, and especially an extended theory of perfectoid rings and perfectoid spaces which generalizes the recent work of Peter Scholze. These aspects were recapitulated in the book ""Foundations for Almost Ring Theory"".

"Maheshinte Prathikaaram () is a 2016 Indian Malayalam-language comedy-drama film directed by Dileesh Pothan, in his directorial debut and produced by Aashiq Abu. The film stars Fahadh Faasil, Anusree, Alencier Ley Lopez, Aparna Balamurali, and Soubin Shahir. Written by Syam Pushkaran, its story is based on an incident in the life of Thampan Purushan from Thuravoor, Cherthala. Shyju Khalid was the film's cinematographer, and its soundtrack and score were composed by Bijibal. The film tells the story of Mahesh Bhavana (Faasil), a photographer, who attempts to defuse a conflict between his friend Crispin (Shahir) and a group of youngsters passing through their village, and is knocked to the ground. Defeated in the tussle and unable to fight back, he is embarrassed in front of his neighbours. Mahesh publicly vows that he will not wear his slippers again until he has avenged the humiliation.

""Maheshinte Prathikaaram"" development began in 2013, when Pothan was working as an associate director for Abu (who was directing ""Idukki Gold"", co-written by Pushkaran). Pushkaran suggested a story idea to Pothan which was based on an incident in his native village. At Pothan's insistence, Pushkaran wrote the screenplay that year and Abu later became interested in producing the film. Production was scheduled to commence from December 2014 after completing the casting process but, due to scheduling conflicts, it was postponed to August 2015. Principal photography began in early August in Idukki and nearby locations, where it was predominantly filmed. Shooting was completed in late October.

""Maheshinte Prathikaaram"" was released in Kerala on 5 February 2016, in the rest of India on 12 February and globally on 26 February. The film was a commercial success, grossing 17.35 crore (173.5 million) at the Kerala box office on a budget of 3.50 crore (35 million). It received critical acclaim with praise going to the performance of its cast, humour, music, cinematography, editing and screenplay. At the 64th National Film Awards, it won the Best Original Screenplay and Best Feature Film in Malayalam, and at the 47th Kerala State Film Awards, it won the Best Original Screenplay and Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value. The film was remade into Tamil as ""Nimir"" (2018) and into Telugu as ""Uma Maheswara Ugra Roopasya"" (2020).","user

The Oder–Neisse line marked the border between East Germany and Poland from 1950 to 1990. Communist East Germany agreed to the border with Communist Poland in 1950, while West Germany, after a period of refusal, adhered to the border (with reservations) in 1970.

"Saint Petersburg (), formerly known as Petrograd (1914–1924) and later Leningrad (1924–1991), is the second-largest city in Russia. It is situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, with a population of roughly 5.4 million residents. Saint Petersburg is the fourth-most populous city in Europe, the most populous city on the Baltic Sea, as well as the world's northernmost city with over 1 million residents. As Russia's Imperial capital, and a historically strategic port, it is governed as a federal city.

The city was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on 27 May 1703 on the site of a captured Swedish fortress, and was named after apostle Saint Peter. Saint Petersburg is historically and culturally associated with the birth of the Russian Empire and Russia's entry into modern history as a European great power. It served as a capital of the Tsardom of Russia and the subsequent Russian Empire from 1713 to 1918 (being replaced by Moscow for a short period of time between 1728 and 1730). After the October Revolution in 1917, the Bolsheviks moved their government to Moscow.

Saint Petersburg is known as the ""Cultural Capital of Russia"", and received over 15 million tourists in 2018. It is considered an important economic, scientific, cultural, and tourism centre of Russia and Europe. In modern times, the city has the nickname of the ""Northern Capital"" and serves as a home to some federal government bodies such as the Constitutional Court of Russia and the Heraldic Council of the President of the Russian Federation. It is also a seat for the National Library of Russia and a planned location for the Supreme Court of Russia, as well as the home to the headquarters of the Russian Navy, and the Western Military District of the Russian Armed Forces.

"The ICD-11 is the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases, due to replace the ICD-10 as the global standard for coding information about diseases and causes of death. The ICD-11 is developed and regularly updated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its development started in 2007 and spanned over a decade of work, involving over 300 specialists from 55 countries divided into 30 work groups, with an additional 10,000 proposals from people all over the world. Following an alpha version in May 2011 and a beta draft in May 2012, a stable version of the ICD-11 was released on 18 June 2018, and officially endorsed by all WHO members during the 72nd World Health Assembly on 25 May 2019.

The ICD-11 is a large taxonomy consisting of tens of thousands of entities, also called classes or nodes. An entity can be anything that is relevant to health care. It usually represents a disease or a pathogen, but it can also be an isolated symptom or (developmental) anomaly of the body. There are also classes for reasons for contact with health services, social circumstances of the patient, and external causes of injury or death. The collection of all ICD-11 entities is called the Foundation Component. From this common core, various subsets can be derived; for example, the ICD-O is a derivative classification optimized for use in oncology. The primary derivative of the Foundation is called the ICD-11 MMS, and it is this system that is commonly referred to as simply ""the ICD-11"". MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics. Both the Foundation Component and the ICD-11 MMS can be viewed online on the WHO's website.

The ICD-11 will officially come into effect on 1 January 2022, at which time member nations may begin reporting morbidity and mortality statistics using the ICD-11 nosology. Each country chooses when to adopt ICD-11, and WHO has acknowledged that ""not many countries are likely to adapt that quickly"", i.e. begin using the ICD-11 by the time of its launch. In the United States, a group that advises the Secretary of Health and Human Services has given an expected implementation year of 2025, but if a clinical modification is determined to be needed (similar to the ICD-10-CM), ICD-11 implementation might not begin until 2027.","user

"The Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar was a fifty-cent piece struck by the United States Bureau of the Mint. Bearing portraits of former U.S. Presidents James Monroe and John Quincy Adams, the coin was issued in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine and was produced at the San Francisco Mint in 1923. Sculptor Chester Beach is credited with the design, although the reverse closely resembles an earlier work by Raphael Beck.

In 1922, the motion picture industry was faced with a number of scandals, including manslaughter charges against star Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle. Although Arbuckle was eventually acquitted, motion picture executives sought ways of getting good publicity for Hollywood. One means was an exposition, to be held in Los Angeles in mid-1923. To induce Congress to issue a commemorative coin as a fundraiser for the fair, organizers associated the exposition with the 100th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, and legislation for a commemorative half dollar for the centennial was passed.

The exposition was a financial failure. The coins did not sell well, and the bulk of the mintage of over 270,000 was released into circulation. Beach faced accusations of plagiarism because of the similarity of the reverse design to a work by Beck, though he and fellow sculptor James Earle Fraser denied any impropriety.

"Nelson King (August 7, 1914 – March 16, 1974) was an American radio disc jockey (DJ) with a nationwide following. Credited by many historians as among the most influential country music DJs in the post-World War II era, the ""King of the country deejays"" was posthumously inducted into the Country Music DJ Hall of Fame in 1975.

Born Charles Schroeder in Portsmouth, Ohio, he graduated from Portsmouth High School in 1932. He worked at radio stations in various cities, as an announcer with ""his resonant speaking voice"", musical director, and host of ""Jam for Supper"", a recorded music program, before joining WCKY in Cincinnati in January 1946.

It was at WCKY that he was asked to choose a radio name, which he picked from a telephone book. (He later legally changed his name to Nelson King.) He hosted several programs, but it was ""Hillbilly Jamboree"" which made him famous. Launched in 1946, the nightly show fueled the growing popularity of country music. The 4½ hour program garnered a national audience and was also heard in Canada, Mexico, and parts of South America. King was courted by record companies and stars such as Gene Autry and Eddy Arnold. He was the top DJ in ""Billboard"" magazine polls for eight consecutive years. He even recorded for King Records. Eventually, however, alcoholism ended his career at WCKY; he was fired in 1961 for going on the air while drunk. He found employment outside of radio, but returned to work as a morning DJ for Cincinnati's WCLU from 1968 to 1970.

"Windham Lawrence Rotunda (born May 23, 1987) is an American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand. He currently performs under two alternating ring names, depending on the character he is portraying on-screen. The first is Bray Wyatt, who is a sinister children's entertainer, and the other is his alternate persona ""The Fiend"", which is a demonic character with supernatural powers.

Rotunda is a third-generation professional wrestler following in the footsteps of his grandfather Blackjack Mulligan, his father Mike Rotunda, and two of his uncles, Barry and Kendall Windham. His younger brother Taylor Rotunda is also a professinal wrestler, best known as Bo Dallas. Alongside his brother, he held the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice while in WWE's then-developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he wrestled under various ring names between 2009 and 2012. He also briefly wrestled on WWE's main roster from 2010 to 2011 under the ring name Husky Harris, most notably as a member of The Nexus.

After returning to WWE's developmental territories, Rotunda was rebranded as Bray Wyatt, the villainous cult leader of The Wyatt Family, with the group eventually making its main roster debut in 2013. He has since become a three-time world champion in WWE, having held the WWE Championship once and the Universal Championship twice. He has also held the SmackDown Tag Team Championship (with Luke Harper and Randy Orton under the Freebird rule) and the Raw Tag Team Championship (with Matt Hardy) once each. After taking a hiatus in August 2018 Wyatt returned to WWE programming in April 2019 with a new gimmick of a children's entertainer, hosting a show called ""Firefly Fun House"".

"Eugeroics (originally ""eugrégorique"" or ""eugregoric""), also known as wakefulness-promoting agents and wakefulness-promoting drugs, are a class of drugs that promote wakefulness and alertness. They are medically indicated for the treatment of certain sleep disorders including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Eugeroics are also often prescribed off-label for the treatment of EDS in idiopathic hypersomnia, a rare and often debilitating sleep disorder which currently has no official treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In contrast to classical psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which are also used in the treatment of these disorders, eugoroics typically do not produce euphoria, and, consequently, have a lower addictive potential. 

Modafinil and armodafinil are each thought to act as selective, weak, atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRI), whereas adrafinil acts as a prodrug for modafinil. Other eugeroics include solriamfetol, which acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and pitolisant, which acts as a histamine 3 (H3) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist.","user

"The 2010 Turkish Grand Prix (formally the 2010 Formula 1 Turkish Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 30 May 2010 at the Istanbul Park, Tuzla, Turkey. It was the seventh round of the 2010 Formula One World Championship and the sixth Turkish Grand Prix. McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton won the 58-lap race starting from second position. His teammate Jenson Button finished second, and Red Bull driver Mark Webber took third.

Webber clinched the pole position and maintained his lead at the start of the race with Hamilton in second who fended off a challenge from Sebastian Vettel in the other Red Bull. The order was maintained until the first sequence of pit stops when Hamilton lost second place after his crew had trouble with fitting one of his tyres correctly. Webber conserved fuel on lap 40 which allowed Vettel to challenge him for the lead but the two collided. Vettel retired and the crash promoted Hamilton and Button to first and second. Hamilton and Button were instructed to conserve fuel for the remainder of the race but the latter had not been giving a target lap time and attempted to overtake Hamilton on lap 48 although the former retained the lead which he held for the remaining ten laps to win his first race of the season.

Hamilton's victory made him the fifth different driver in seven races to win a Grand Prix in 2010. The result extended Webber's advantage over second place in the Drivers' Championship, now occupied by Button, by five points. Hamilton's victory elevated him to third place, while Alonso fell from third to fourth. Vettel's retirement demoted him from second to fifth. McLaren's 1–2 finish reduced Red Bull's lead in the Constructors' Championship to one point. Ferrari fell from second to third after a poor result, with 12 races left of the season.","user

"This Is What the Truth Feels Like is the third studio album by American singer Gwen Stefani. It was released on March 18, 2016, by Interscope Records. Initially, the album was scheduled to be released in December 2014 with Stefani working with a handful of high-profile producers, and Benny Blanco serving as executive producer. However, after the underperformance of her 2014 singles and the writer's block Stefani suffered, she did not feel comfortable curating an album and scrapped the whole record in favor of starting again. The album's release was scheduled after Stefani hinted at it on her Twitter account.

Inspired by both the end of her marriage and eventual newfound romance, Stefani returned to writing new songs. With the help of producers J.R. Rotem, Mattman & Robin, and Greg Kurstin, as well as songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels, Stefani wrote the album in a few months. Describing it as a breakup record, she created songs with a sarcastic and dark-humor vibe, in addition to ones that felt real, joyful, and happy. Musically, ""This Is What the Truth Feels Like"" is a pop record that is similar to the material on Stefani's previous studio albums. The record includes a guest appearance by rapper Fetty Wap.

The album received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its honest and vulnerable nature and considered it her most personal album. However, some thought the album was too calculated and did not capture the essence of a breakup album because it lacked a clear focus. Commercially, the album was moderately successful, becoming Stefani's first number one on the ""Billboard"" 200; in several other major music markets, it peaked within the top 40 on the charts. To further promote the album, Stefani embarked on her third concert tour, the This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour with rapper Eve in North America and headlined the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre Final Shows with opening act Young the Giant.

The album's official lead single, ""Used to Love You"", was released on October 20, 2015, to a positive response and had moderate success on the charts. Its second single, ""Make Me Like You"", was released on February 12, 2016, with a similar reception. The accompanying music video was the first to be created live on television, and was broadcast during a commercial break for the 2016 Grammy Awards. ""Misery"" was originally issued as a promotional single before being released as the album's third single on May 23, 2016.","user

Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg entered the round with an eleven-point lead over teammate Lewis Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship. Mercedes held a 103-points advantage over Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship. During Saturday's qualifying session, Hamilton achieved the 55th pole position of his career to start from the front of the grid, ahead of Rosberg and Max Verstappen.

The race began behind the safety car due to rain shortly before the start. Hamilton was able to convert his pole position into a third straight victory at the British Grand Prix, leading home Rosberg and Verstappen in changing conditions. Rosberg came under investigation by the race stewards after he received detailed instructions by his team how to work around a gearbox problem in the closing laps of the race, a practice forbidden under Formula One regulations. He was later handed a ten-second time penalty, demoting him to third place. The result saw Rosberg's championship lead reduced to just a single point over Hamilton.","user

This race was the seventy-first running of the British Grand Prix, the first having been held in 1926, and was the tenth round of the 2016 FIA Formula One World Championship and the fiftieth time that the race was held at the Silverstone Circuit since the Formula One series inception in .

Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg entered the round with an eleven-point lead over teammate Lewis Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship. Mercedes held a 103-points advantage over Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship. During Saturday's qualifying session, Hamilton achieved the 55th pole position of his career to start from the front of the grid, ahead of Rosberg and Max Verstappen.

The race began behind the safety car due to rain shortly before the start. Hamilton was able to convert his pole position into a third straight victory at the British Grand Prix, leading home Rosberg and Verstappen in changing conditions. Rosberg came under investigation by the race stewards after he received detailed instructions by his team how to work around a gearbox problem in the closing laps of the race, a practice forbidden under Formula One regulations. He was later handed a ten-second time penalty, demoting him to third place. The result saw Rosberg's championship lead reduced to just a single point over Hamilton.

"LP Andromedae (often abbreviated to LP And) is a carbon star in the constellation Andromeda. It is also a Mira variable whose mean apparent visual magnitude is 15.12 and has pulsations with an amplitude of 1.50 magnitudes and a period of 614 days.

In 1974 LP Andromedae, known then as IRC+40540, was identified as a carbon star and also shown to be variable. It had previously been suspected of variability during the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). A detailed study of its spectrum showed an unusually cool star with a basic class of C8, and Swan band strength of 3.5. It also showed strong C13 isotopic bands. The period was narrowed down to around 614 days, one of the longest periods known for a Mira variable.

This star has a dusty envelope with an estimated mass of 3.2 , fueled by the star itself which is losing mass at a rate 1.9 /yr. Such a high mass loss rate should place LP Andromedae close to the end of its asymptotic giant branch evolution. The envelope extends to a distance of 3 parsec from the star, and is mainly made of silicon carbide and carbon particles.","user

"El Vocero de Puerto Rico is a Puerto Rican free newspaper that is published in San Juan. Published since 1974, ""El Vocero"" was at first the third of the four largest Puerto Rico newspapers, trailing ""El Mundo"" and ""El Nuevo Día"" and leading ""El Reportero"" and ""The San Juan Star"" in sales. With the temporary demise in the late 1980s of ""El Mundo"", ""El Vocero"" became even more popular, becoming the island's largest newspaper by 1994. From 1985 to 2013 it was owned by Caribbean International News Corp. The owners of Caribbean International News Corp, and therefore owners of ""El Vocero"", were Elliot Stein, I. Martin Pompadur and The Henry Crown Co.

In the beginning, ""El Vocero"" was known as a sensationalist tabloid that dramatized all the violent news. Writers included Tomas De Jesus Mangual and others. However, in the early 2000s, the newspaper changed its direction, becoming a mainstream newspaper, adding a much broader coverage of entertainment as well as business related news, and carrying more political news, as in the situation in Vieques.

In addition to its regular news section, ""El Vocero"" also has business, entertainment, sports, and travel sections.

On April 8, 2007, Gaspar Roca, the paper's founding publisher and editor in chief died due to respiratory arrest. He was replaced by his son Miguel Roca. As of January 2011 Miguel Roca was no longer working at the newspaper, and was replaced by a San Juan-based construction lawyer named Peter Miller. Due to financial difficulties, in December 2013 ""El Vocero"" went bankrupt (Chapter 7). The new owner and publisher is Publi-Inversiones, formed by a group of local entrepreneurs.","user

"Mount Parnassus (; , ""Parnassós"") is a mountain in central Greece that towers above Delphi, north of the Gulf of Corinth.

Mount Parnassus offers many advantages to the population of Greece. In peace, it possesses scenic views of the countryside and features olive groves and rolling hills. The mountain is also the location of historically, archaeologically, and culturally significant places of interest (such as Delphi). Recreationally, the slopes of Parnassus provide a medium for hiking (in the three warm seasons) and are skied in winter. Its melting snows provide water to the surrounding communities, reaching out as far as Athens. The mountain is composed of limestone, and its rock contains bauxite, ore that is rich in aluminum. In war, Parnassus has been a center of resistance if need be, providing cover and refuge to partisans.

Parnassus is commonly represented in early Ancient Greek literature. Many of its ancient communities are cited in Homer's Iliad. From a linguistic point of view, it was home to states of the Dorians, such as the Phokians, who spoke a Doric dialect, Phokian. According to Greek mythology, this mountain was sacred to Dionysus and the Dionysian mysteries; it was also sacred to Apollo and the Corycian nymphs, and it was the home of the Muses.

However, there is a significant gap in the proto-history of the name, Parnassos. Mycenaean settlements were abundant to the south and east. They had good views of Parnassus, and climbed some part of it frequently, and yet the name remains unattested in what is known of their language, Mycenaean Greek, which is written in Linear B script.","user

"The Championships, Wimbledon, commonly known simply as Wimbledon or The Championships, is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious. It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts, since 2009 with a retractable roof over Centre Court, and since 2019 over No. 1 Court.

Wimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open and the US Open. Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass, which is the traditional tennis playing surface.

The tournament traditionally took place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. However, changes to the tennis calendar in 2015 have seen the event moved back by a week to begin in early July. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place.

Wimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors and royal patronage. Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament. In 2017, fans consumed 34,000kg (33 imperial tons) of British strawberries and 10,000 litres (2,200 imperial gallons) of cream.

The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts, with the exception of Rolex, which provides timekeeping technology during matches, IBM, Oppo, Slazenger, and Robinsons barley water.

In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras, per court, to capture the games.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Championships were cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World War II.","user

"The Corinth Canal () connects the Gulf of Corinth in the Ionian Sea with the Saronic Gulf in the Aegean Sea. It cuts through the narrow Isthmus of Corinth and separates the Peloponnese from the Greek mainland, arguably making the peninsula an island. The canal was dug through the isthmus at sea level and has no locks. It is in length and only wide at its base, making it impassable for many modern ships.

"Súaltam (Súaltaim, Súaldam, Súaldaim, Súaltach) mac Róich is the mortal father of the hero Cúchulainn in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. His wife is Deichtine, sister of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster. His brother is Fergus mac Róich.

The nature of Cúchulainn's parentage is unclear and inconsistent. In one version, Deichtine fosters the baby son of Lugh, but he becomes sick and dies. Then she is made pregnant by Lugh, who tells her to name the child Sétanta, but as she is betrothed to Súaltam, she aborts the pregnancy, marries Súaltam and has his child, whom she names Sétanta. The child is later renamed Cúchulainn. In another version, Deichtine disappears from Emain Macha, until the nobles of Ulster are led by a flock of magical birds to a house, where they are welcomed by Lugh. He tells them his wife is due to give birth soon, and when she does the Ulstermen discover she is Deichtine. The child is named Sétanta. He is brought up by Súaltam and Deichtine in their house on Muithemne Plain in County Louth.

Seventeen years later, when queen Medb of Connacht launches the ""Táin Bó Cúailnge"" (Cattle Raid of Cooley) against Ulster, Cúchulainn and Súaltam are watching the border at Iraird Cuilenn (Crossakiel, County Meath). While Cúchulainn tries to hold up the army's advance, Súaltam goes to warn the Conchobar. For unexplained reasons, he does not arrive at Emain Macha for several months. He burst in and cries out that men are being killed, women abducted, and cattle plundered, and that Ailill mac Máta, king of Connacht, is responsible. However, he is ignored, for he has failed to follow precedence - no man could speak before the king, and the king could not speak before his three druids - and Conchobar and his druids agree he should be executed. As Súaltam runs out, he falls against the sharpened rim of his shield and decapitates himself. His severed head is brought back on his shield still crying out that men are being murdered, women abducted and cattle plundered.

"Maxwell's demon is a thought experiment that would hypothetically violate the second law of thermodynamics. It was proposed by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1867.

In the thought experiment, a demon controls a small massless door between two chambers of gas. As individual gas molecules (or atoms) approach the door, the demon quickly opens and closes the door to allow only fast-moving molecules to pass through in one direction, and only slow-moving molecules to pass through in the other. Because the kinetic temperature of a gas depends on the velocities of its constituent molecules, the demon's actions cause one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down. This would decrease the total entropy of the two gases, without applying any work, thereby violating the second law of thermodynamics.

The concept of Maxwell's demon has provoked substantial debate in the philosophy of science and theoretical physics, which continues to the present day. It stimulated work on the relationship between thermodynamics and information theory. Most scientists argue, on theoretical grounds, that no practical device can violate the second law in this way. Other researchers have implemented forms of Maxwell's demon in experiments, though they all differ from the thought experiment to some extent and none have been shown to violate the second law.","user

"Diwali (; Deepavali (IAST: ""dīpāvali"") or Divali; related to Jain Diwali, Bandi Chhor Divas, Tihar, Swanti, Sohrai and Bandna) is a festival of lights and one of the major festivals celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some Buddhists, notably Newar Buddhists. The festival usually lasts five days and is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar month Kartika (between mid-October and mid-November). One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual ""victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance"". The festival is widely associated with Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, with many other regional traditions connecting the holiday to Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Yama, Yami, Durga, Kali, Hanuman, Ganesha, Kubera, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. Furthermore, it is, in some regions, a celebration of the day Lord Rama returned to his kingdom Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile.

In the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants will prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with ""diyas"" (oil lamps) and ""rangolis"" (colorful art circle patterns). During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with ""diyas"" and ""rangoli"", perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth, light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where ""mithai"" (sweets) and gifts are shared. Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh and Jain diaspora.

The five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts. Diwali is usually celebrated twenty days after the Vijayadashami (Dussehra, Dasara, Dasain) festival, with Dhanteras, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the festival when celebrants prepare by cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as ""rangolis"". The second day is Naraka Chaturdashi. The third day is the day of Lakshmi Puja and the darkest night of the traditional month. In some parts of India, the day after Lakshmi Puja is marked with the Govardhan Puja and Balipratipada (Padwa). Some Hindu communities mark the last day as Bhai Dooj or the regional equivalent, which is dedicated to the bond between sister and brother, while other Hindu and Sikh craftsmen communities mark this day as Vishwakarma Puja and observe it by performing maintenance in their work spaces and offering prayers.

Some other faiths in India also celebrate their respective festivals alongside Diwali. The Jains observe their own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira, the Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal Empire prison, while Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh generally celebrate Diwali, by worshipping goddess Kali. The main day of the festival of Diwali (the day of Lakshmi Puja) is an official holiday in Fiji, Guyana, India, Malaysia (except Sarawak), Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.","user

The festival is widely associated with Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, with many other regional traditions connecting the holiday to Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Yama, Yami, Durga, Kali, Hanuman, Ganesha, Kubera, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. Furthermore, it is, in some regions, a celebration of the day Lord Rama returned to his kingdom Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile.

In the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants will prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with ""diyas"" (oil lamps) and ""rangolis"" (colorful art circle patterns). During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with ""diyas"" and ""rangoli"", perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth, light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where ""mithai"" (sweets) and gifts are shared. Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh and Jain diaspora.

The five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts. Diwali is usually celebrated twenty days after the Vijayadashami (Dussehra, Dasara, Dasain) festival, with Dhanteras, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the festival when celebrants prepare by cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as ""rangolis"". The second day is Naraka Chaturdashi. The third day is the day of Lakshmi Puja and the darkest night of the traditional month. In some parts of India, the day after Lakshmi Puja is marked with the Govardhan Puja and Balipratipada (Padwa). Some Hindu communities mark the last day as Bhai Dooj or the regional equivalent, which is dedicated to the bond between sister and brother, while other Hindu and Sikh craftsmen communities mark this day as Vishwakarma Puja and observe it by performing maintenance in their work spaces and offering prayers.

Some other faiths in India also celebrate their respective festivals alongside Diwali. The Jains observe their own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira, the Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal Empire prison, while Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh generally celebrate Diwali, by worshipping goddess Kali. The main day of the festival of Diwali (the day of Lakshmi Puja) is an official holiday in Fiji, Guyana, India, Malaysia (except Sarawak), Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.

"Badfinger were a Welsh rock band formed in Swansea, Wales, who were active from the 1960s to the 1980s. Their best-known lineup consisted of Pete Ham, Mike Gibbins, Tom Evans, and Joey Molland. They are recognised for their influence on the 1970s power pop genre. It is estimated that the band sold 14 million albums.

The band evolved from an earlier group called The Iveys, formed in 1961, which became the first group signed by the Beatles' Apple label in 1968. The band renamed themselves Badfinger, after the working title for the Beatles' 1967 song ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" (""Bad Finger Boogie""). From 1968 to 1973, Badfinger recorded five albums for Apple and toured extensively, before they became embroiled in the chaos of Apple's dissolution.

Badfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: ""Come and Get It"" (written and produced by Paul McCartney, 1970), ""No Matter What"" (produced by Mal Evans, 1970), ""Day After Day"" (produced by George Harrison, 1971), and ""Baby Blue"" (produced by Todd Rundgren, 1972). Their song ""Without You"" (1970) has been recorded many times, and became a US and UK number-one hit for Harry Nilsson and, two decades later, a UK number-one for Mariah Carey.

After Apple Records folded in 1973, Badfinger struggled with a host of legal, managerial, and financial problems, leading to Ham taking his own life in 1975. The surviving members struggled to rebuild their personal and professional lives against a backdrop of lawsuits, which tied up the songwriters' royalty payments for years. Their subsequent albums floundered, as Molland and Evans alternated between co-operation and conflict in their attempts to revive and capitalise on the Badfinger legacy. In 1983, Evans followed Ham in suicide. Gibbins died in 2005, leaving Molland as the group's only surviving member.","user

"Seleucus I Nicator (; ; ) was a Greek general and one of the Diadochi, the rival generals, relatives, and friends of Alexander the Great who fought for control over his empire after his death. Having previously served as an infantry general under Alexander the Great, he eventually assumed the title of basileus (king) and established the Seleucid Empire, one of the major powers of the Hellenistic world, which controlled most of Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and the Iranian Plateau until overcome by the Roman Republic and Parthian Empire in the late second and early first centuries BC.

After the death of Alexander in June 323 BC, Seleucus initially supported Perdiccas, the regent of Alexander's empire, and was appointed Commander of the Companions and chiliarch at the Partition of Babylon in 323 BC. However, after the outbreak of the Wars of the Diadochi in 322, Perdiccas' military failures against Ptolemy in Egypt led to the mutiny of his troops in Pelusium. Perdiccas was betrayed and assassinated in a conspiracy by Seleucus, Peithon and Antigenes in Pelusium sometime in either 321 or 320 BC. At the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC, Seleucus was appointed Satrap of Babylon under the new regent Antipater. But almost immediately, the wars between the Diadochi resumed and one of the most powerful of the Diadochi, Antigonus, forced Seleucus to flee Babylon. Seleucus was only able to return to Babylon in 312 BC with the support of Ptolemy. From 312 BC, Seleucus ruthlessly expanded his dominions and eventually conquered the Persian and Median lands. Seleucus ruled not only Babylonia, but the entire enormous eastern part of Alexander's empire.

Seleucus further made claim to the former satraps in Gandhara and in eastern India. However these ambitions were contested by Chandragupta Maurya, resulting in the Seleucid–Mauryan War (305–303 BC). The conflict was ultimately resolved by a treaty resulting in the Maurya Empire annexing the eastern satraps. Additionally, a marriage alliance between the two empires was formalized with Chandragupta marrying Seleucus' daughter. Furthermore, the Seleucid Empire received a considerable military force of 500 war elephants with mahouts, which would play a decisive role against Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. In 281 BC, he also defeated Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium, adding Asia Minor to his empire. 

Seleucus' victories against Antigonus and Lysimachus left the Seleucid dynasty virtually unopposed amongst the Diadochi. However, Seleucus also hoped to take control of Lysimachus' European territories, primarily Thrace and Macedon itself. But upon arriving in Thrace in 281 BC, Seleucus was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court with his sister Lysandra. The assassination of Seleucus destroyed Seleucid prospects in Thrace and Macedon, and paved the way for Ptolemy Ceraunus to absorb much of Lysimachus' former power in Macedon. Seleucus was succeeded by his son Antiochus I as ruler of the Seleucid Empire.

Seleucus founded a number of new cities during his reign, including Antioch (300 BC) and Seleucia on the Tigris (c. 305 BC), a foundation that eventually depopulated Babylon.","user

The Wa traditionally practiced subsistence agriculture by cultivating rice, peas, beans, poppies and walnuts. They bred water buffaloes, which they used mainly for sacrificial purposes. Generally, the traditional customs of the Wa, as well as their lifestyle, are very similar to those of the Naga people further to the Northwest.

Many of the Wa are animists and a small proportion of the population follows a derivative of either Buddhism or Christianity. The Wa were once known as the ""Wild Wa"" by the British due to their practice of headhunting.

"Earl of the County of Cork, usually shortened to Earl of Cork, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland, held in conjunction with the Earldom of Orrery since 1753. It was created in 1620 for the Anglo-Irish politician Richard Boyle, 1st Baron Boyle. He had already been created Lord Boyle, Baron of Youghal, in the County of Cork, in 1616, and was made Viscount of Dungarvan, in the County of Waterford, at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of Ireland. 

Known as the ""Great Earl"", Richard Boyle was born in Canterbury, England, but settled in Ireland in 1588, where he married an Irish heiress and bought large estates in County Cork. From 1631 to 1643 he served as Lord Treasurer of Ireland. His third son, the Hon. Sir Roger Boyle was created Earl of Orrery in 1660. The first Earl of Cork was remarkable for having four of his sons created peers; his remaining son was Robert Boyle, the scientist, discoverer of Boyle's Law.

Lord Cork was succeeded by his second son, another Richard Boyle, the second Earl; his eldest son died young. This Richard Boyle had already succeeded his younger brother as second Viscount Boyle of Kinalmeaky according to a special remainder in the letters patent. He married Elizabeth Clifford, 2nd Baroness Clifford, and in 1644 he was created Baron Clifford of Lanesborough, in the County of York, in the Peerage of England. Lord Cork later served as Lord High Treasurer of Ireland and as Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1664 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Burlington in the Peerage of England. His only son and heir apparent Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan, was summoned to the Irish House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Viscount Dungarvan in 1663. He later represented Tamworth and Yorkshire in the English House of Commons. In 1689 he was summoned to the English House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Clifford of Lanesborough. 

Lord Cork was succeeded by his grandson, the third Earl, the son of Viscount Dungarvan. He was Lord Treasurer of Ireland and Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. On his death the titles passed to his only son, the fourth Earl of Cork and third Earl of Burlington. Known as Lord Burlington, he was the famous architect who published Andrea Palladio's designs of Ancient Roman architecture and designed Chiswick House with William Kent. He had no sons and on his death in 1753 the barony of Clifford of Lanesborough and earldom of Burlington became extinct. He was succeeded in the Burlington estates and in the barony of Clifford by his eldest surviving daughter Charlotte Elizabeth Boyle, 6th Baroness Clifford (see the Baron Clifford for later history of this title). She married William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire. Their third son Lord George Augustus Henry Cavendish was created Earl of Burlington in 1831.

Lord Burlington was succeeded in the earldom of Cork and the other remaining titles by his third cousin John Boyle, 5th Earl of Orrery, who became the fifth Earl of Cork as well (he was descended from the ""third"" son of the first Earl of Cork, and had also inherited the titles of Baron Broghill [Ireland] and Baron Boyle of Marston in the Peerage of Great Britain, thus a seat in the British House of Lords until 1999 (see the Earl of Orrery for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was a writer and a friend of Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the sixth Earl. He represented Charleville in the Irish House of Commons and Warwick in the British House of Commons. He died unmarried at the age of thirty-three and was succeeded by his half-brother, Edmund Boyle, 7th Earl of Cork. The seventh Earl is remembered only for the fame of his second wife Mary Boyle, Countess of Cork and Orrery, the celebrated Lady Cork whose salon was a centre of intellectual life for fifty years. On his death in 1798 the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, the eighth Earl. He was a General in the Army and fought in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. 
He was succeeded by his grandson, the ninth Earl. He was the son of Captain Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan.

    Earl of the County of Cork, usually shortened to Earl of Cork, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland, held in conjunction with the Earldom of Orrery since 1753. It was created in 1620 for the Anglo-Irish politician Richard Boyle, 1st Baron Boyle. He had already been created Lord Boyle, Baron of Youghal, in the County of Cork, in 1616, and was made Viscount of Dungarvan, in the County of Waterford, at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of Ireland. 

Known as the ""Great Earl"", Richard Boyle was born in Canterbury, England, but settled in Ireland in 1588, where he married an Irish heiress and bought large estates in County Cork. From 1631 to 1643 he served as Lord Treasurer of Ireland. His third son, the Hon. Sir Roger Boyle was created Earl of Orrery in 1660. The first Earl of Cork was remarkable for having four of his sons created peers; his remaining son was Robert Boyle, the scientist, discoverer of Boyle's Law.

Lord Cork was succeeded by his second son, another Richard Boyle, the second Earl; his eldest son died young. This Richard Boyle had already succeeded his younger brother as second Viscount Boyle of Kinalmeaky according to a special remainder in the letters patent. He married Elizabeth Clifford, 2nd Baroness Clifford, and in 1644 he was created Baron Clifford of Lanesborough, in the County of York, in the Peerage of England. Lord Cork later served as Lord High Treasurer of Ireland and as Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1664 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Burlington in the Peerage of England. His only son and heir apparent Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan, was summoned to the Irish House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Viscount Dungarvan in 1663. He later represented Tamworth and Yorkshire in the English House of Commons. In 1689 he was summoned to the English House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Clifford of Lanesborough. 

Lord Cork was succeeded by his grandson, the third Earl, the son of Viscount Dungarvan. He was Lord Treasurer of Ireland and Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. On his death the titles passed to his only son, the fourth Earl of Cork and third Earl of Burlington. Known as Lord Burlington, he was the famous architect who published Andrea Palladio's designs of Ancient Roman architecture and designed Chiswick House with William Kent. He had no sons and on his death in 1753 the barony of Clifford of Lanesborough and earldom of Burlington became extinct. He was succeeded in the Burlington estates and in the barony of Clifford by his eldest surviving daughter Charlotte Elizabeth Boyle, 6th Baroness Clifford (see the Baron Clifford for later history of this title). She married William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire. Their third son Lord George Augustus Henry Cavendish was created Earl of Burlington in 1831.

Lord Burlington was succeeded in the earldom of Cork and the other remaining titles by his third cousin John Boyle, 5th Earl of Orrery, who became the fifth Earl of Cork as well (he was descended from the ""third"" son of the first Earl of Cork, and had also inherited the titles of Baron Broghill [Ireland] and Baron Boyle of Marston in the Peerage of Great Britain, thus a seat in the British House of Lords until 1999 (see the Earl of Orrery for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was a writer and a friend of Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the sixth Earl. He represented Charleville in the Irish House of Commons and Warwick in the British House of Commons. He died unmarried at the age of thirty-three and was succeeded by his half-brother, Edmund Boyle, 7th Earl of Cork. The seventh Earl is remembered only for the fame of his second wife Mary Boyle, Countess of Cork and Orrery, the celebrated Lady Cork whose salon was a centre of intellectual life for fifty years. On his death in 1798 the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, the eighth Earl. He was a General in the Army and fought in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. 
He was succeeded by his grandson, the ninth Earl. He was the son of Captain Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan. Lord Cork was a Liberal politician and served as Master of the Buckhounds and as Master of the Horse under",NA,NA
"Creative destruction (German: ""schöpferische Zerstörung""), sometimes known as Schumpeter's gale, is a concept in economics which since the 1950s is the most readily identified with the Austrian-born economist Joseph Schumpeter who derived it from the work of Karl Marx and popularized it as a theory of economic innovation and the business cycle.

According to Schumpeter, the ""gale of creative destruction"" describes the ""process of industrial mutation that continuously revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one"". In Marxian economic theory the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of wealth under capitalism.

The German sociologist Werner Sombart has been credited with the first use of these terms in his work ""Krieg und Kapitalismus"" (""War and Capitalism"", 1913). In the earlier work of Marx, however, the idea of creative destruction or annihilation (German: ""Vernichtung"") implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders, but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth (whether through war, dereliction, or regular and periodic economic crises) in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth.

In ""Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy"" (1942), Joseph Schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of Marx's thought (to which the whole of Part I of the book is devoted), arguing (in Part II) that the creative-destructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system (see below). Despite this, the term subsequently gained popularity within mainstream economics as a description of processes such as downsizing in order to increase the efficiency and dynamism of a company. The Marxian usage has, however, been retained and further developed in the work of social scientists such as David Harvey, Marshall Berman, Manuel Castells and Daniele Archibugi.","user

"Paul Samuel 'Pops' Whiteman (March 28, 1890 – December 29, 1967) was an American bandleader, composer, orchestral director, and violist.

As the leader of one of the most popular dance bands in the United States during the 1920s and early 1930s, Whiteman produced recordings that were immensely successful, and press notices often referred to him as the ""King of Jazz"". His most popular recordings include ""Whispering"", ""Valencia"", ""Three O'Clock in the Morning"", ""In a Little Spanish Town"", and ""Parade of the Wooden Soldiers"". Whiteman led a usually large ensemble and explored many styles of music, such as blending symphonic music and jazz, as in his debut of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" by George Gershwin.

Whiteman recorded many jazz and pop standards during his career, including ""Wang Wang Blues"", ""Mississippi Mud"", ""Rhapsody in Blue"", ""Wonderful One"", ""Hot Lips (He's Got Hot Lips When He Plays Jazz)"", ""Mississippi Suite"", ""Grand Canyon Suite"", and ""Trav'lin' Light"". He co-wrote the 1925 jazz classic ""Flamin' Mamie"". His popularity faded in the swing music era of the mid-1930s, and by the 1940s he was semi-retired from music. He experienced a revival and had a comeback in the 1950s with his own network television series, ""Paul Whiteman's Goodyear Revue"", which ran for three seasons on ABC. He also hosted the 1954 ABC talent contest show ""On the Boardwalk with Paul Whiteman"".

Whiteman's place in the history of early jazz is somewhat controversial. Detractors suggest that his ornately orchestrated music was jazz in name only, lacking the genre's improvisational and emotional depth, and co-opted the innovations of black musicians. Defenders note that Whiteman's fondness for jazz was genuine. He worked with black musicians as much as was feasible during an era of racial segregation. His bands included many of the era's most esteemed white musicians, and his groups handled jazz admirably as part of a larger repertoire.

Critic Scott Yanow declares that Whiteman's orchestra ""did play very good jazz...His superior dance band used some of the most technically skilled musicians of the era in a versatile show that included everything from pop tunes and waltzes to semi-classical works and jazz. [...] Many of his recordings (particularly those with Beiderbecke) have been reissued numerous times and are more rewarding than his detractors would lead one to believe.""

"Ronald James Padavona (July 10, 1942 – May 16, 2010), known professionally as Ronnie James Dio, was an American heavy metal singer-songwriter and composer. He fronted or founded numerous groups throughout his career, including Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio, and Heaven & Hell.

Though his parents were from Cortland, New York, Dio was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where his family resided for his father's service in the U.S. Army during World War II; they soon returned to Cortland. Dio's music career began there in 1957 as part of the Vegas Kings (later Ronnie and the Rumblers). In 1967, he formed the rock band Elf, which became a regular opening act for Deep Purple. In 1975, Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore founded the band Rainbow and hired Dio to be his lead singer; during his tenure, the band released three studio albums. Dio quickly emerged as one of heavy rock's pre-eminent vocalists. In 1979, Dio replaced Ozzy Osbourne as Black Sabbath's lead singer and appeared on three studio albums with the band, all three of which met with success: ""Heaven & Hell"" (1980), ""Mob Rules"" (1981) and ""Dehumanizer"" (1992). In 1982, he left to form the band Dio, which itself had two albums certified platinum by the RIAA. In 2006, he founded the band Heaven & Hell with ex-bandmate Tony Iommi. In 2009, Dio was diagnosed with stomach cancer, and he died of the affliction the following year.

Dio is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal artists of all time. He is known for popularizing the ""Metal Horns"" hand gesture in metal culture and his medieval-themed song lyrics. According to a version provided by the singer himself, the act derives directly from the classic Italian apotropaic gesture, which his grandmother usually did. Dio had a powerful, versatile vocal range and was capable of singing both hard rock and lighter ballads. He was awarded the ""Metal Guru Award"" by ""Classic Rock Magazine"" in 2006. He was also named the ""Best Metal singer"" at the ""Revolver"" Golden Gods Awards in 2010 and ranked as the genre's best vocalist in 2013 by music journalist Sacha Jenkins.","user

"Sertraline, sold under the brand name Zoloft among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants, and the differences are mostly confined to side effects. Sertraline is better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants, and it may work better than fluoxetine for some subtypes of depression. Sertraline is effective for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). However, for OCD, cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly in combination with sertraline, is a better treatment. Although approved for post-traumatic stress disorder, sertraline leads to only modest improvement in this condition. Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently for its treatment.
Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, and sexual side effects, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild. Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a higher rate of suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under the age of 25. It should not be used together with MAO inhibitor medication: this combination causes serotonin syndrome. Sertraline taken during pregnancy is associated with a significant increase in congenital heart defects in newborns.
Sertraline was invented and developed by scientists at Pfizer and approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is available as a generic medication.

    Sertraline, sold under the brand name Zoloft among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants, and the differences are mostly confined to side effects. Sertraline is better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants, and it may work better than fluoxetine for some subtypes of depression. Sertraline is effective for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). However, for OCD, cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly in combination with sertraline, is a better treatment. Although approved for post-traumatic stress disorder, sertraline leads to only modest improvement in this condition. Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently for its treatment.
Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, and sexual side effects, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild. Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a higher rate of suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under the age of 25. It should not be used together with MAO inhibitor medication: this combination causes serotonin syndrome. Sertraline taken during pregnancy is associated with a significant increase in congenital heart defects in newborns.
Sertraline was invented and developed by scientists at Pfizer and approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is available as a generic medication. In 2016, sertraline was the most commonly prescribed psychiatric medication in the United States and in 2018, it was the fourteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with over 38 million prescriptions.

"The sievert (symbol: Sv) is a derived unit of ionizing radiation dose in the International System of Units (SI) and is a measure of the health effect of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body. The sievert is important in dosimetry and radiation protection, and is named after Rolf Maximilian Sievert, a Swedish medical physicist renowned for work on radiation dose measurement and research into the biological effects of radiation.

The sievert is used for radiation dose quantities such as equivalent dose and effective dose, which represent the risk of external radiation from sources outside the body, and committed dose which represents the risk of internal irradiation due to inhaled or ingested radioactive substances. The sievert is intended to represent the stochastic health risk, which for radiation dose assessment is defined as the probability of radiation-induced cancer and genetic damage. One sievert carries with it a 5.5% chance of eventually developing fatal cancer based on the linear no-threshold model.

To enable consideration of stochastic health risk, calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity absorbed dose into equivalent dose and effective dose, the details of which depend on the radiation type and biological context. For applications in radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these. These are under continual review, and changes are advised in the formal ""Reports"" of those bodies.

Conventionally, the sievert is not used for high dose rates of radiation that produce deterministic effects, which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, such as acute radiation syndrome; these effects are compared to the physical quantity absorbed dose measured by the unit gray (Gy). 

One sievert equals 100 rem. The rem is an older, non-SI unit of measurement. For electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays and gamma rays, the gray and sievert are equivalent (a sievert is the biological impact of one gray of electromagnetic radiation), but they diverge for types of radiation that are more biologically damaging, such as neutrons and alpha radiation, where one gray of absorbed radiation may produce 20 sieverts of biological effect.","user

For applications in radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these. These are under continual review, and changes are advised in the formal ""Reports"" of those bodies.

Conventionally, the sievert is not used for high dose rates of radiation that produce deterministic effects, which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, such as acute radiation syndrome; these effects are compared to the physical quantity absorbed dose measured by the unit gray (Gy). 

One sievert equals 100 rem. The rem is an older, non-SI unit of measurement. For electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays and gamma rays, the gray and sievert are equivalent (a sievert is the biological impact of one gray of electromagnetic radiation), but they diverge for types of radiation that are more biologically damaging, such as neutrons and alpha radiation, where one gray of absorbed radiation may produce 20 sieverts of biological effect.

"Urination is the release of urine from the urinary bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body. It is the urinary system's form of excretion. It is also known medically as micturition, voiding, uresis, or, rarely, emiction, and known colloquially by various names including peeing, weeing, and pissing.

In healthy humans (and many other animals) the process of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury, urination may occur as a reflex. It is normal for adult humans to urinate up to seven times during the day.

In some animals, in addition to expelling waste material, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness. Physiologically, urination involves coordination between the central, autonomic, and somatic nervous systems. Brain centres that regulate urination include the pontine micturition center, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral cortex. In placental mammals, urine is drained through the urinary meatus, a urethral opening in the male penis or female vulval vestibule.","user

"Pancreatic juices are a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living. 

Pancreatic juice is alkaline in nature due to the high concentration of bicarbonate ions. Bicarbonate is useful in neutralizing the acidic gastric acid, allowing for effective enzymic changes.

Pancreatic juice secretion is principally regulated by the hormones secretin and cholecystokinin, which are produced by the walls of the duodenum, and by the action of autonomic innervation. 

The release of these hormones into the blood is stimulated by the entry of the acidic chyme into the duodenum.

The coordinated action of the aforementioned hormones results in the secretion of a large volume of the pancreatic juice, which is alkaline and enzyme-rich, into duodenum. The pancreas also receives autonomic innervation. The blood flow into pancreas is regulated by sympathetic nerve fibers, while parasympathetic neurons stimulate the activity of acinar and centroacinar cells.

Pancreatic secretion is an aqueous solution of bicarbonate originating from the duct cells and enzymes originating from the acinar cells. The bicarbonate assists in neutralising the low pH of the chyme coming from the stomach, while the enzymes assist in the breakdown of the proteins, lipids and carbohydrates for further processing and absorption in the intestines. Secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice can be collected during endoscopy and provides an important source for diagnostic biomarkers, allowing detection of pancreatic pathology, especially cancer not yet visible on medical imaging..

Pancreatic juice is secreted into the duodenum through duodenal papillae. Some individuals have also an accessory duct, named accessory pancreatic duct, which may be functional (that is, it also empties the contents of the exocine pancreas into the duodenum) or non-functional.","user

"The southern muriqui (""Brachyteles arachnoides"") is a muriqui (woolly spider monkey) species endemic to Brazil. It is found in the Brazilian states of Paraná, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais. This New World monkey is known locally as ""mono carvoeiro"", which translates to ""charcoal monkey"".

Muriquis are the largest New World monkeys and largest non-human native primates in the Americas. Male muriquis have a head-body length of , with a tail of and a body weight of . Females have a head-body length of , a tail length of and a body weight of . The tails are fully prehensile.

The southern muriqui, ""B. arachnoides"", has a solid black face, distinguishing it from the northern species, ""B. hypoxanthus"", which has a black face mottled with pink.

Southern muriqui are frugivores, which means that fruit is the ""preferred"" food type. They have been claimed to possess the most diverse fruit diet in the Atlantic, and also consume leaves and flowers.

This species is considered endangered because of habitat destruction, hunting pressures, and historic population declines. Only two captive populations of the southern muriqui exist. They are housed at the zoos of Curitiba and Sorocaba. The latter is located 80 km from the only long-term investigation of the southern muriqui in continuous forest, the Carlos Botelho State Park. The wild population was estimated at 1,300 in 2005.

Like chimpanzees, male southern muriquis are philopatric, while females immigrate to spread genetic diversity and avoid incestuous breeding with their relatives. They preferentially eat fruit, flowers, and buds and rely on tree bark and leaves as fallback food.

Males within a community are tolerant of each other and intergroup aggression is rare. Although this species is nicknamed the ""hippie monkey"", due to their relaxed intergroup relationships, their attitude towards outsider males is far from harmonious, as group of males was observed killing a male from outside their group(a trait shared with chimpanzees), though it is not known if this degree of aggression is natural or induced due to a lack of recourses.

"The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (c.53) of the UK Parliament enables some criminal convictions to be ignored after a rehabilitation period. Its purpose is that people do not have a lifelong blot on their records because of a relatively minor offence in their past. The rehabilitation period is automatically determined by the sentence. After this period, if there has been no further conviction the conviction is ""spent"" and, with certain exceptions, need not be disclosed by the ex-offender in any context such as when applying for a job, obtaining insurance, or in civil proceedings. A conviction for the purposes of the ROA includes a conviction issued outside Great Britain (see s1(4) of the 1974 Act) and therefore foreign convictions are eligible to receive the protection of the ROA.

Under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (section 139), the Act as it applies in England and Wales was updated to provide new rehabilitation periods – with most convictions becoming spent in a shorter amount of time. For adults, the rehabilitation period is one year for community orders, two years for custodial sentences of six months or less, four years for custodial sentences of over six months and up to and including 30 months, and seven years for custodial sentences of over 30 months and up to and including 48 months. Custodial sentences of over four years will never become spent and must continue to be disclosed when necessary. Under the 2012 Act, the rehabilitation period starts on the date of conviction in the case of fines, but for custodial sentences it starts after the offender has completed the sentence (including time on licence) and for community orders it starts when the order ceases to have effect. For example, an offender who received a two-year prison sentence will see the conviction spent six years from date of conviction (two year sentence plus four year rehabilitation period). For offenders who are under the age of 18 when convicted, the rehabilitation period is half that of an adult.

A conviction that is spent under British law may not be so considered elsewhere. For example, criminal convictions must be disclosed when applying to enter the United States; spent convictions are not excluded for US immigration purposes under US law.

The Act makes it an offence for anyone with access to criminal records to disclose spent convictions unless authorised to do so. The Act makes it a more serious offence to obtain such information by means of fraud, dishonesty or bribery.","user

Its purpose is that people do not have a lifelong blot on their records because of a relatively minor offence in their past. The rehabilitation period is automatically determined by the sentence. After this period, if there has been no further conviction the conviction is ""spent"" and, with certain exceptions, need not be disclosed by the ex-offender in any context such as when applying for a job, obtaining insurance, or in civil proceedings. A conviction for the purposes of the ROA includes a conviction issued outside Great Britain (see s1(4) of the 1974 Act) and therefore foreign convictions are eligible to receive the protection of the ROA.

Under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (section 139), the Act as it applies in England and Wales was updated to provide new rehabilitation periods – with most convictions becoming spent in a shorter amount of time. For adults, the rehabilitation period is one year for community orders, two years for custodial sentences of six months or less, four years for custodial sentences of over six months and up to and including 30 months, and seven years for custodial sentences of over 30 months and up to and including 48 months. Custodial sentences of over four years will never become spent and must continue to be disclosed when necessary. Under the 2012 Act, the rehabilitation period starts on the date of conviction in the case of fines, but for custodial sentences it starts after the offender has completed the sentence (including time on licence) and for community orders it starts when the order ceases to have effect. For example, an offender who received a two-year prison sentence will see the conviction spent six years from date of conviction (two year sentence plus four year rehabilitation period). For offenders who are under the age of 18 when convicted, the rehabilitation period is half that of an adult.

A conviction that is spent under British law may not be so considered elsewhere. For example, criminal convictions must be disclosed when applying to enter the United States; spent convictions are not excluded for US immigration purposes under US law.

The Act makes it an offence for anyone with access to criminal records to disclose spent convictions unless authorised to do so. The Act makes it a more serious offence to obtain such information by means of fraud, dishonesty or bribery.

"The International League of Christian Esperantists (Esperanto: ""Kristana Esperantista Ligo Internacia"", KELI) is the association of protestant Esperantists. It was founded in 1911, during the Universal Congress of Esperanto in [[Antwerp]. Its members from very diverse backgrounds, mostly protestant churches. KELI publishes a bimonthly magazine, ""Dia Regno"", which started to appear regularly in 1908, when the [[Germany|German]] [[Paul Hübner]] was sure that five people would subscribe. Now the magazine serves as a tool among members in 48 countries from diverse faiths, [[Adventism|Adventists]] to [[Quakers]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], etc., but also people of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

In the beginning, it was important to have basic literature. In 1912, the [[New Testament]] was published and then in 1926 the entire [[Bible]] with the [[Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof|Zamenhof]]'s [[Old Testament]] translation - not privately, but in the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. That way, it is possible to continually have Esperanto Bibles in every Christian Bookstore throughout the entire world. Also, an edition having the [[deuterocanonical books]] (translated by Gerrit berveling of [[Netherlands]]) was published in 2003. In 1971, KELI had an official hymnal ""Adoru Kantante"" (Worship by Singing) with 262 songs (mostly classics), from many countries and languages, with four part harmony - a beautiful book, done professionally. Recently, conferences have used more modest looking song collections, ""Tero kaj Chielo Kantu"" (Earth and Heaven Sing) with 161 songs, since people preferred more modern music. ""Adoru"", an ecumenical worship book co-edited with the catholic association [[IKUE]], containing texts, prayers and hymnals appeared in June 2001.

After the war, KELI started to organize an annual conference with concerns about working out a program about work, study, entertainment, the conference country and local churches. More and more, because of good communication with IKUE, the Roman Catholic Esperanto-Union, the annual conferences happened together, for the first time in 1968 in Limburg/Lahn. They attracted between 90 and 200 people, many of which were IKUE or KELI members.

At Universal Congresses, IKUE and KELI try to have communion together if possible. Often, they are among the great number of visited programs of the congress week.

From the start, KELI supported the actions for the blind by the Dutchman, Jacques Tuinder, known under the name ""Agado E3"", or now E-vid-ente. Now, its help focuses on Albania, but does not forget other aspects of misery for people with poor sight.

The task of KELI goes in two directions: to inform the Church and other Christian groups about Esperanto, and to inform the Esperanto community about Christianity.","user

"Socrates on Trial is a play depicting the life and death of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. It tells the story of how Socrates was put on trial for corrupting the youth of Athens and for failing to honour the city's gods. The play contains adaptations of several classic Greek works: the slapstick comedy, ""Clouds"", written by Aristophanes and first performed in 423 BCE; the dramatic monologue, ""Apology"", written by Plato to record the defence speech Socrates gave at his trial; and Plato's ""Crito"" and ""Phaedo"", two dialogues describing the events leading to Socrates’ execution in 399 BCE. The play was written by Andrew David Irvine of the University of British Columbia and premiered by director Joan Bryans of Vital Spark Theatre Company in 2007 at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts in Vancouver.

In the judgment of one reviewer, the play succeeds in presenting Socrates both as Plato's wise mentor and as the “pompous, arrogant and often petulant” teacher presented by Aristophanes, giving modern audiences a greater appreciation of why Socrates eventually ended up being sentenced to death.

In the judgment of another reviewer, the play is “a worthy analogue of an ancient masterpiece.”","user

"Steven Universe is an American animated television series created by Rebecca Sugar for Cartoon Network. It is Cartoon Network's first animated series to be created solely by a woman. The show tells the coming-of-age story of a young boy, Steven Universe (Zach Callison), who lives with the Crystal Gems—magical, humanoid aliens named Garnet (Estelle), Amethyst (Michaela Dietz), and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall)—in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem, has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. Its pilot was first shown in May 2013, and the series ran for five seasons, from November 2013 to January 2019. The TV film ""Steven Universe: The Movie"" was released in September 2019, and an epilogue limited series, ""Steven Universe Future"", ran from December 2019 to March 2020.

The themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who was an artist for the series. She developed ""Steven Universe"" while she was a writer and storyboard artist on ""Adventure Time"", which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is storyboard-driven; the show's storyboard artists were responsible for writing the dialogue and creating the action in addition to drawing the storyboards. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released.

The series has developed a broad fanbase and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of LGBTQ themes and science fantasy worldbuilding. The series won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Kids & Family Program in 2019, becoming the first animated series to win the award. It also received a Peabody Award for Children's & Youth Programming in 2019. It was nominated for five Emmy Awards and five Annie Awards.","user

"The Rosedale Valley Bridge (also called the Rosedale Ravine Bridge) is a covered arch bridge in the northeast of Downtown Toronto, Ontario. Built in 1966 by architect John B. Parkin (now part of Delcan Corporation), the concrete bridge carries Line 2 trains of the subway across the Rosedale Ravine.

The eastern end of the Rosedale Valley Bridge is situated at the west end of Castle Frank station. The bridge itself runs on the north side of and almost parallel to the Rosedale section of the Prince Edward Viaduct. The viaduct opened in 1918 and had a lower deck over its entire length designed for rail transport. When the first phase of the Bloor subway line opened, its tracks used the lower deck of the main phase across the Don River Valley to the east as originally intended. However, since the approach curves leading to the Rosedale section would be too sharp for the trains, the dedicated Rosedale Valley Bridge was built to carry them, and the lower deck of the original viaduct remains unused.

Although the bridge once had open skylights for ventilation, they were later covered to reduce noise to the surrounding area. It can be seen from the north side of Bloor Street, which crosses from the adjacent Prince Edward Viaduct, or from below on Rosedale Valley Road which it passes over.","user

"A Mutt in a Rut is a 1959 Warner Bros. ""Looney Tunes"" animated short directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on May 23, 1959 and features Elmer Fudd.

The story concerns Elmer's dog, ""Wover"", who, after watching a television show about dogs, is determined to protest how he is treated, but after going hunting, every intention to hurt or kill Elmer backfires on him...in a good way.

This short is notable for being the final time Arthur Q. Bryan voices Elmer Fudd during his lifetime, as he died in November 1959, six months after this short’s release.

The second Sirimavo Bandaranaike cabinet saw Ceylon severing the last colonial ties with Britain as the country became a parliamentary republic in May 1972. The country was also renamed Sri Lanka.

"Saint Ursus of Toul, known in French as Saint Ours, was a 5th-century French bishop of Toul and a saint of the Roman Catholic Church with a locally venerated feast day celebrated on 1 March.

Ours was elected bishop of Toul in 490, succeeding Saint Auspicius. When the Frankish king Clovis invaded Gaul, Ours welcomed him during his visit to Toul in 496. Clovis requested an ecclesiastic to instruct him in the teaching of Christianity and Bishop Ours designated one of his priests, Saint Waast, to convert the new sovereign.

Ours died at an uncertain date, perhaps around the year 500. His remains were buried initially in the graveyard of Saint-Mansuy. His body was translated, however, in 1026 to the Abbey of St. Mansuy. His successor was Saint Epvre of Toul.

Ours was declared a saint by the Catholic Church. His feast day was formerly celebrated on 4 September but is now celebrated on 1 March.","user

"Sensitive Prince (April 1, 1975 – January 24, 1991) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse. Out of the mare Sensitive Lady, he was sired by U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Majestic Prince.

Sensitive Price had the misfortune of being born in the same year as two future Hall of Fame horses, that year's U.S. Triple Crown champion Affirmed and his prime challenger, Alydar.

As a three-year-old, Sensitive Prince won Kentucky Derby prep races in Florida and at Keeneland Race Course. In the 1978 Kentucky Derby, under jockey Mickey Solomone, he took the lead early and held it until the field turned for home before fading to finish sixth. Later that year he finished second in record time to Affirmed in the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga Race Course but won three important races including the Jerome Handicap at Belmont Park.

Racing at age four, Sensitive Prince got his first important win of 1979 in the Gulfstream Park Handicap then added two more handicap wins before being retired to stud at the end of the racing season having set three track records during his career.

As a sire, Sensitive Prince stood for a time at Wimbledon Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. He met with only modest success, siring six stakes winners.","user

"The Heliodorus pillar is a stone column that was erected around 113 BCE in central India in Besnagar (near Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh). The pillar was called the ""Garuda-standard"" by Heliodorus, referring to the deity Garuda. The pillar is commonly named after Heliodorus, who was an ambassador of the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas from Taxila, and was sent to the Indian ruler Bhagabhadra. A dedication written in Brahmi script was inscribed on the pillar, venerating Vāsudeva, the ""Deva deva"" the ""God of Gods"" and the Supreme Deity. The pillar also glorifies the Indian ruler as ""Bhagabhadra the savior"". The pillar is a stambha which symbolizes joining earth, space and heaven, and is thought to connote the ""cosmic axis"" and express the cosmic totality of the Deity.

The Heliodorus pillar site is located near the confluence of two rivers, about northeast from Bhopal, from the Buddhist stupa of Sanchi, and from the Hindu Udayagiri site.

The pillar was discovered by Alexander Cunningham in 1877. Two major archaeological excavations in the 20th-century have revealed the pillar to be a part of an ancient Vāsudeva temple site. Aside from religious scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita, the epigraphical inscriptions on the Heliodorus pillar and the Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions contain some of the earliest known writings of Vāsudeva-Krishna devotion and early Vaishnavism and are considered the first archeological evidence of its existence. The pillar is also one of the earliest surviving records of a foreign convert into Vaishnavism. Alternatively, making dedications to foreign gods was only a logical practice for the Greeks, intended to appropriate their local power.

"The Pacific island nation Nauru first competed at the Summer Olympic Games in the 1996 games in Atlanta. It is nation with the smallest population in the 206-member International Olympic Committee. The nation is mainly known for its weightlifting tradition and all seven athletes that had competed for Nauru at the Olympics before 2012 were weightlifters.

Under the leadership of Vinson Detenamo, the Olympic movement began in Nauru in the early 1990s. The Olympic Committee was established in 1991 and talks with the International Olympic Committee started the same year.

"Francesco Antonio Rosetti (c. 1750 – 30 June 1792, born Franz Anton Rösler, changed to Italianate form by 1773) was a classical era composer and double bass player, and was a contemporary of Haydn and Mozart. The occasional disambiguation with a supposed, but non-existent, ""Antonio Rosetti born 1744 in Milan"", is due to an error by Ernst Ludwig Gerber in a later edition of his ""Tonkünstler-Lexikon"" having mistaken Rosetti for an Italian in the first edition of his own Lexikon, and therefore including Rosetti twice - once as an Italian, once as a German-Czech.

Rosetti was born about 1750 in Litoměřice, a town in Northern Bohemia. He is believed to have received early musical training from the Jesuits in Prague. In 1773 Rosetti left his native country and found employment in the Hofkapelle of Prince Kraft Ernst of Oettingen-Wallerstein whom he served for sixteen years, becoming Kapellmeister in 1785. In July 1789 Rosetti left Wallerstein to accept the post of Kapellmeister to the Duke Friedrich Franz I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in Ludwigslust where he died in service of the duke on 30 June 1792 at the age of 42 years. In 1777, he married Rosina Neher, with whom he had three daughters. In late 1781 he was granted leave to spend 5 months in Paris. Many of the finest ensembles in the city performed his works. Rosetti arranged for his music to be published, including a set of six symphonies published in 1782. He returned to his post, assured of recognition as an accomplished composer. 

Rosetti wrote over 400 compositions, primarily instrumental music including many symphonies and concertos which were widely published. Rosetti also composed a significant number of vocal and choral works, particularly in the last few years of his life. Among these are German oratorios including ""Der sterbende Jesu"" and ""Jesus in Gethsemane"" (1790) and a German ""Hallelujah"". The English music historian Charles Burney included Rosetti among the most popular composers of the period in his work ""A General History of Music"". Rosetti is perhaps best known today for his horn concertos, which Mozart scholar H. C. Robbins Landon suggests (in ""The Mozart Companion"") may have been a model for Mozart's four horn concertos. Rosetti is also known for writing a Requiem (1776) which was performed at a memorial for Mozart in December 1791.

Attributing some music to Rosetti is difficult because several other composers with similar names worked at the same time, including Franciscus Xaverius Antonius Rössler.","user

"AMSAT-OSCAR 51 or AO-51 is the in-orbit name designation of a now defunct (following battery failure) LEO amateur radio satellite of the OSCAR series; formerly known as ECHO, built by AMSAT. It was launched on June 29, 2004 from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on a Dnepr launch vehicle. It is in sun synchronous low Earth orbit.

AO-51 contained an FM repeater with both 144 MHz (VHF) and 1.2 GHz (L band) uplinks and 435 MHz (UHF) and 2.4 GHz (S band) downlinks. It also contained a digital subsystem that transmitted telemetry on 70 cm and provided a complete PACSAT BBS that could be configured on both V band and S band uplinks. As well, there was a 10-meter PSK uplink.

AO-51 had four VHF receivers, two UHF transmitters, six modems, and 56 channels of telemetry. The two UHF transmitters were connected to four phased antennas, yielding right-hand circular polarization for the 435.300 downlink and left-hand circular polarization for the 435.150 downlink.

The AO-51 FM satellite was easily workable with an amateur radio VHF dual band hand-held radio, as long as you knew when the satellite's footprint was within reach. Transatlantic contacts had been made without much effort, as long as the satellite was approximately mid-Atlantic so that the edge of the satellites footprint was within reach on either continent.

As of May 2011 the satellite faced problems with the battery. By September, a work around for the battery issue was found, bringing the repeater back in use. On November 29, 2011, the AO-51 Command Team announced that AO-51 has ceased transmission and is not responding to commands.","user

"The Winnipeg River is a Canadian river that flows roughly northwest from Lake of the Woods in the province of Ontario to Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba. This river is long from the Norman Dam in Kenora to its mouth at Lake Winnipeg. Its watershed is in area, mainly in Canada. About of the watershed is in northern Minnesota, United States.

The Winnipeg River watershed was the southeasternmost portion of the land granted in 1670 to the Hudson's Bay Company. The portion in Canada corresponds roughly to the land deeded to Canada in Treaty 3, signed in 1873 by Her Majesty's treaty commissioners and the First Nation chiefs at Northwest Angle on the Lake of the Woods. The river's name means ""murky water"" in Cree.

This river route was used by natives for thousands of years before European contact. French and English colonists also began to use the river in order to reach First Nations for the fur trade, with trade interactions for hundreds of years. It is the only major water route between what is now Ontario and southern Manitoba that was easily navigable by canoe. The Red River route was much farther south and had a longer portage. La Vérendrye was one of the first explorers to establish fur trade forts near the First Nations camps along the river.

The river section through Whiteshell Provincial Park has many petroforms near the Whiteshell River forks where the two rivers meet. These petroforms are an ancient reminder of the importance of the area for native travel, trade, ceremonies, harvesting, and settlements.","user

"Thomas Tuchel (; born 29 August 1973) is a German professional football manager and former player who is the current head coach of Premier League club Chelsea. Highly revered for his tactical knowledge, he is considered one of the best managers in the world.
Born in Krumbach, Tuchel's playing career ended at age 25, as a result of a chronic knee cartilage injury, and in 2000, he began his coaching career, working for the youth teams at VfB Stuttgart for five years. In 2009, following a successful one-year period at FC Augsburg II, he was hired by newly promoted Bundesliga club Mainz 05.

Tuchel guided Mainz to league stability during his five seasons at the club, and gained plaudits for his brand of energetic, attacking football. He also cultivated a reputation for his focus on promoting youth players. He departed Mainz in 2014 as a result of financial disputes, and in 2015, was appointed at fellow Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, where he won the DFB-Pokal before being dismissed in 2017.

He was hired by French club Paris Saint-Germain in 2018, where he won two league titles, including a domestic quadruple in his second season, and guided the club to its first UEFA Champions League final.

    Thomas Tuchel (; born 29 August 1973) is a German professional football manager and former player who is the current head coach of Premier League club Chelsea. Highly revered for his tactical knowledge, he is considered one of the best managers in the world.
Born in Krumbach, Tuchel's playing career ended at age 25, as a result of a chronic knee cartilage injury, and in 2000, he began his coaching career, working for the youth teams at VfB Stuttgart for five years. In 2009, following a successful one-year period at FC Augsburg II, he was hired by newly promoted Bundesliga club Mainz 05.

Tuchel guided Mainz to league stability during his five seasons at the club, and gained plaudits for his brand of energetic, attacking football. He also cultivated a reputation for his focus on promoting youth players. He departed Mainz in 2014 as a result of financial disputes, and in 2015, was appointed at fellow Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, where he won the DFB-Pokal before being dismissed in 2017.

He was hired by French club Paris Saint-Germain in 2018, where he won two league titles, including a domestic quadruple in his second season, and guided the club to its first UEFA Champions League final. However, Tuchel was dismissed in 2020 and was then appointed by English club Chelsea in 2021, where he won the UEFA Champions League in his debut season.
