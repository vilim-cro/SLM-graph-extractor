"""A Death"" is a short story by Stephen King, first published in the March 9, 2015 issue of ""The New Yorker"", and collected in the November 3 collection ""The Bazaar of Bad Dreams"".

"Datolite is a calcium boron hydroxide nesosilicate, CaBSiO4(OH). It was first observed by Jens Esmark in 1806, and named by him from δατεῖσθαι, ""to divide,"" and λίθος, ""stone,"" in allusion to the granular structure
of the massive mineral.

Datolite crystallizes in the monoclinic system forming prismatic crystals and nodular masses. The luster is vitreous and may be brown, yellow, light green or colorless. The Mohs hardness is 5.5 and the specific gravity is 2.8 - 3.0. 

The type localities are in the diabases of the Connecticut River valley and Arendal, Aust-Agder, Norway. Associated minerals include prehnite, danburite, babingtonite, epidote, native copper, calcite, quartz and zeolites. It is common in the copper deposits of the Lake Superior region of Michigan. It occurs as a secondary mineral in mafic igneous rocks often filling vesicles along with zeolites in basalt. Unlike most localities throughout the world, the occurrence of datolite in the Lake Superior region is usually fine grained in texture and possesses colored banding. Much of the coloration is due to the inclusion of copper or associated minerals in progressive stages of hydrothermal precipitation.

Victor later regrets meddling with nature through his creation, as he inadvertently endangers his own life and the lives of his family and friends when the creature seeks revenge against him.

"Arthur W. Perdue Stadium is a baseball stadium in Salisbury, Maryland. It is the home of the Baltimore Orioles Low-A East affiliate Delmarva Shorebirds. Named for the founder of Perdue Farms, Arthur Perdue, it features the Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame. The stadium seats 5,200 fans and opened in 1996.

As the second-largest seating venue in Salisbury, it also occasionally is used for concerts or other events. Until 2016, the larger Wicomico Youth and Civic Center had a real covenant against serving alcohol. As such, the stadium was chosen as the venue for Fernando Guerrero's middleweight title-winning boxing match in October 2009.

The University of Maryland Eastern Shore Hawks of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) played their 2018 and 2019 seasons at Perdue Stadium while Hawk Stadium in Princess Anne was renovated. Perdue Stadium hosted the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Baseball Tournament from 2015 to 2017.

In 1998, the stadium hosted the Delmarva Rockfish, a team in the single-season Maryland Fall Baseball league.","user

"The Caniapiscau River () is a tributary of the Koksoak River in Nunavik, Quebec, Canada. In Cree the name of the river means ""rocky point"".

Since 1985, the headwaters of the Caniapiscau River have been diverted into the La Grande hydroelectric complex.

"Romaine Brooks (born Beatrice Romaine Goddard; May 1, 1874 – December 7, 1970) was an American painter who worked mostly in Paris and Capri. She specialized in portraiture and used a subdued tonal palette keyed to the color gray. Brooks ignored contemporary artistic trends such as Cubism and Fauvism, drawing on her own original aesthetic inspired by the works of Charles Conder, Walter Sickert, and James McNeill Whistler. Her subjects ranged from anonymous models to titled aristocrats. She is best known for her images of women in androgynous or masculine dress, including her self-portrait of 1923, which is her most widely reproduced work.

Brooks had an unhappy childhood after her alcoholic father abandoned the family; her mother was emotionally abusive and her brother mentally ill. By her own account, her childhood cast a shadow over her whole life. She spent several years in Italy and France as a poor art student, then inherited a fortune upon her mother's death in 1902. Wealth gave her the freedom to choose her own subjects. She often painted people close to her, such as the Italian writer and politician Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Russian dancer Ida Rubinstein, and her partner of more than 50 years, the writer Natalie Barney.

Although she lived until 1970, it is erroneously believed that she painted very little after 1925; despite evidence to the contrary. She made a series of drawings during the 1930s, using an ""unpremeditated"" techniques predating automatic drawing. She spent time in New York City in the mid 1930s, completing portraits of Carl Van Vechten and Muriel Draper. Many of her works are unaccounted for, but photographic reproductions attest to her ongoing artwork. It is thought to have culminated in her 1961 portrait of Duke Uberto Strozzi.","user

She specialized in portraiture and used a subdued tonal palette keyed to the color gray. Brooks ignored contemporary artistic trends such as Cubism and Fauvism, drawing on her own original aesthetic inspired by the works of Charles Conder, Walter Sickert, and James McNeill Whistler. Her subjects ranged from anonymous models to titled aristocrats. She is best known for her images of women in androgynous or masculine dress, including her self-portrait of 1923, which is her most widely reproduced work.

Brooks had an unhappy childhood after her alcoholic father abandoned the family; her mother was emotionally abusive and her brother mentally ill. By her own account, her childhood cast a shadow over her whole life. She spent several years in Italy and France as a poor art student, then inherited a fortune upon her mother's death in 1902. Wealth gave her the freedom to choose her own subjects. She often painted people close to her, such as the Italian writer and politician Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Russian dancer Ida Rubinstein, and her partner of more than 50 years, the writer Natalie Barney.

Although she lived until 1970, it is erroneously believed that she painted very little after 1925; despite evidence to the contrary. She made a series of drawings during the 1930s, using an ""unpremeditated"" techniques predating automatic drawing. She spent time in New York City in the mid 1930s, completing portraits of Carl Van Vechten and Muriel Draper. Many of her works are unaccounted for, but photographic reproductions attest to her ongoing artwork. It is thought to have culminated in her 1961 portrait of Duke Uberto Strozzi.

There are 11 National Battlefields, nine National Military Parks, four National Battlefield Parks, and one National Battlefield Site. The National Park Service does not distinguish among the four designations in terms of their preservation or management policies.

Seventeen sites are from the American Civil War, four from the American Revolutionary War, one from the War of 1812, one from the French and Indian War, and two were attacks on Native Americans.

In 1890, Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park was the first such site created by Congress.

"In control theory and stability theory, the Nyquist stability criterion or Strecker–Nyquist stability criterion, independently discovered by the German electrical engineer at Siemens in 1930 and the Swedish-American electrical engineer Harry Nyquist at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1932, is a graphical technique for determining the stability of a dynamical system. Because it only looks at the Nyquist plot of the open loop systems, it can be applied without explicitly computing the poles and zeros of either the closed-loop or open-loop system (although the number of each type of right-half-plane singularities must be known). As a result, it can be applied to systems defined by non-rational functions, such as systems with delays. In contrast to Bode plots, it can handle transfer functions with right half-plane singularities. In addition, there is a natural generalization to more complex systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, such as control systems for airplanes.

The Nyquist criterion is widely used in electronics and control system engineering, as well as other fields, for designing and analyzing systems with feedback. While Nyquist is one of the most general stability tests, it is still restricted to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Non-linear systems must use more complex stability criteria, such as Lyapunov or the circle criterion. While Nyquist is a graphical technique, it only provides a limited amount of intuition for why a system is stable or unstable, or how to modify an unstable system to be stable. Techniques like Bode plots, while less general, are sometimes a more useful design tool.","user

"Ethiopian Semitic (also Ethio-Semitic, Ethiosemitic, Ethiopic or Abyssinian) is a family of languages spoken in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan. They form the western branch of the South Semitic languages, itself a sub-branch of Semitic, part of the Afroasiatic language family.

With 21,811,600 total speakers as of 2007, including around 4,000,000 second language speakers, Amharic is the most widely spoken language of Ethiopia (but second as a first language after Oromo) and second-most commonly spoken Semitic language in the world (after Arabic). Tigrinya has 7 million speakers and is the most widely spoken language in Eritrea. There is a small population of Tigre speakers in Sudan, and it is the second-most spoken language in Eritrea. The Ge'ez language has a literary history in its own Ge'ez script going back to the first century AD. It is no longer spoken but remains the liturgical language of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, as well as their respective Eastern Catholic counterparts.

The ""homeland"" of the South Semitic languages is widely debated, with sources such as A. Murtonen (1967) and Lionel Bender (1997), suggesting an origin in Ethiopia and others suggesting the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula. A study based on a Bayesian model to estimate language change concluded that the latter viewpoint may be more probable.

"Godzilla vs. Kong is a 2021 American monster film directed by Adam Wingard. A sequel to """" (2019) and """" (2017), it is the fourth film in Legendary's ""MonsterVerse"". It is also the 36th film in the ""Godzilla"" franchise, the twelfth film in the ""King Kong"" franchise, and the fourth ""Godzilla"" film to be completely produced by a Hollywood studio. The film stars Alexander Skarsgård, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Shun Oguri, Eiza González, Julian Dennison, Lance Reddick, Kyle Chandler, and Demián Bichir. In the film, Kong clashes with Godzilla as humans lure the ape into the Hollow Earth to retrieve a power source for a weapon to stop Godzilla's mysterious rampages.

The project was announced in October 2015 when Legendary declared plans for a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and King Kong. The film's writers room was assembled in March 2017, and Wingard was announced as the director in May 2017. Principal photography began in November 2018 in Hawaii, Australia and Hong Kong, and wrapped in April 2019.

After being delayed from a November 2020 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" was theatrically released internationally on March 24, 2021, and in the United States on March 31, where it was also released on HBO Max simultaneously. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the visual effects and action sequences, but criticism towards the script and human characters. It broke several pandemic box office records, and has grossed over $444 million worldwide, against a production budget between $155–200 million and a break-even point of $330 million, making it the third highest-grossing film of 2021. The film was also a streaming hit, becoming the most successful launch item in HBO Max's history at the time of its release.","user

"Max Payne 3 is a third-person shooter video game developed by Rockstar Studios and published by Rockstar Games. It was released on May 15, 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360; a Microsoft Windows port was released on May 29, 2012, followed by an OS X port on June 20, 2013. The game is the third entry in the ""Max Payne"" series and the sequel to ""Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne.""

The game is played from a third-person perspective. Throughout the single-player mode, players control Max Payne, a former NYPD detective. Nine years after the events of the second game, Max finds work as a private security contractor in São Paulo, Brazil, but becomes entangled in a quest filled with death and betrayal. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay in re-creations of multiple single-player settings.

As part of their research for the game's setting, the developers conducted field research around São Paulo throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. At release, ""Max Payne 3"" received highly positive reactions from critics, with praise particularly directed at its narrative, atmosphere, attention to detail and action, though some criticism was aimed at the change in style from its predecessors, its linear design, and depiction of São Paulo. ""Max Payne 3"" achieved high sales, shipping approximately three million units in the first week of release. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades from several gaming publications, winning a variety of them.","user

"""I'm with Cupid"" is the fourteenth episode of ""The Simpsons"" tenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on Valentine's Day, 1999. The episode takes place on Valentine's Day, and the wives of Springfield are jealous of the attention Apu gives to his wife Manjula. Angered by this, Moe and the Springfield husbands spy on Apu to sabotage his romantic plans.

""I'm with Cupid"" was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Bob Anderson. Because the episode was to air on Valentine's Day, Fox wanted the episode to relate to the holiday, although the idea for the episode was pitched by Greaney. The title of the episode is based on the popular T-shirt slogan ""I'm with stupid"". Elton John guest-starred as himself, and recorded a new version of his song ""Your Song"" for the episode. The episode also features references to ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", Tiffany & Co. and ""Lisa the Vegetarian"", an earlier episode in the series.

In its original broadcast, ""I'm With Cupid"" was seen by approximately 7.7 million viewers and finished in 48th place in the ratings the week it aired.

Following the home media release of ""The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season"", the episode received generally positive reviews from critics.","user

"Jackie Tyler is a fictional character played by Camille Coduri in the British science fiction television series ""Doctor Who"". The character, a resident of contemporary London, is introduced in the first episode of the 2005 revival as the mother of Rose Tyler, a travelling companion of the alien time traveller the Doctor. Jackie is a recurring character during the 2005 and 2006 series of the show, and later makes one-off appearances in 2008 and 2010. The character has also appeared in expanded universe material such as the ""Doctor Who"" New Series Adventures novels and the ""Doctor Who Magazine"" comic strip.

Within the series narrative, Jackie is a widow who lives alone with her daughter Rose until Rose leaves her mundane life behind to travel through time and space with the Doctor. Jackie's feeling of loss and of being left behind is explored in subsequent episodes. As the character is brought into danger by her proximity to the Doctor, she resents his influence over Rose. However, once he undergoes a regeneration, effectively becoming a new man, Jackie has a more cordial relationship with him. The character was written out at the end of the 2006 series, along with Rose, in a storyline which sees them trapped in a parallel universe where Jackie forms a new relationship with an alternate version of her deceased husband Pete Tyler.

In reviving the television series after a sixteen-year hiatus (1989–2005), executive producer Russell T Davies was keen to provide a believable background for the Doctor's companion and a context for her travels to the past and future. The character of Jackie was created, along with Rose's on/off boyfriend Mickey, to keep the series grounded in reality. In writing Jackie, Davies incorporated both comic and tragic elements. Following the departure of the Tyler family, Davies was keen to bring Jackie back alongside Rose for future appearances. Reviewers generally reacted positively to the development of the character, though some identified unlikeable traits.","user

"Gangs of New York is a 2002 American epic historical crime film that was directed by Martin Scorsese, set in the New York City slums, and inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1927 nonfiction book ""The Gangs of New York"". The screenplay was written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz.
In 1863, a long-running Catholic–Protestant feud erupts into violence, just as an Irish immigrant group is protesting the low wages caused by an influx of freed slaves as well as the threat of conscription. Scorsese spent 20 years developing the project until Harvey Weinstein and his production company Miramax Films acquired it in 1999.

Made in Cinecittà, Rome, and in New York, the film was completed by 2001, but its release was delayed by the September 11 attacks. Released on December 20, 2002, the film grossed $193 million worldwide against its $100 million budget. Reviewers praised Day-Lewis' performance, Scorsese's directing, and the film's production and costume design but criticized the story. The film received 10 Oscar nominations at the 75th Academy Awards but won none.","user

"Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 gigahertz (GHz) to as low as 30 hertz (Hz). At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm (shorter than a grain of rice); at 30 Hz the corresponding wavelength is 10,000 km (longer than the radius of the Earth). Like all electromagnetic waves, radio waves in a vacuum travel at the speed of light, and in the Earth's atmosphere at a close, but slightly lower speed. Radio waves are generated by charged particles undergoing acceleration, such as time-varying electric currents. Naturally occurring radio waves are emitted by lightning and astronomical objects, and are part of the blackbody radiation emitted by all warm objects.

Radio waves are generated artificially by transmitters and received by radio receivers, using antennas. Radio waves are very widely used in modern technology for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and radio navigation systems, communications satellites, wireless computer networks and many other applications. Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves can diffract around obstacles like mountains and follow the contour of the earth (ground waves), shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and return to earth beyond the horizon (skywaves), while much shorter wavelengths bend or diffract very little and travel on a line of sight, so their propagation distances are limited to the visual horizon.

To prevent interference between different users, the artificial generation and use of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which defines radio waves as ""electromagnetic waves of frequencies arbitrarily lower than 3 000 GHz, propagated in space without artificial guide"". The radio spectrum is divided into a number of radio bands on the basis of frequency, allocated to different uses.","user

"Carlos Ray ""Chuck"" Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist, actor, film producer, and screenwriter. He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and judo. After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do. Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in martial arts. Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the spy film ""The Wrecking Crew"" (1969). Friend and fellow actor Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in ""Way of the Dragon"" (1972). While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested to him that he take it seriously. Norris took the starring role in the action film ""Breaker! Breaker!"" (1977), which turned a profit. His second lead ""Good Guys Wear Black"" (1978) became a hit, and Norris became a popular action film star.

Norris would go on to star in a streak of bankable independently-made action and martial arts films, with ""A Force of One"" (1979), ""The Octagon"" (1980), and ""An Eye for an Eye"" (1981). This made Norris an international celebrity. He went on to make studio films like ""Silent Rage"" (1982) with Columbia, ""Forced Vengeance"" (1982) with MGM, and ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" (1983) with Orion. This led Cannon films to sign Norris into a multiple film deal, starting with ""Missing in Action"" (1984), which proved to be very successful and launched a trilogy. Norris started to work almost exclusively on high-profile action films with Cannon, becoming their leading star during the 1980s. Films with Cannon included ""Invasion U.S.A"" (1985), ""The Delta Force"" (1986), ""Firewalker"" (1986), etc. Apart from the Cannon films, Norris made ""Code of Silence"" (1985), which was received as one of his best films. In the 1990s, he played the title role in the long running television series ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" from 1993 until 2001. Until 2006, Norris continued taking lead roles in action movies, including ""Delta Force 2"" (1990), ""The Hitman"" (1991), ""Sidekicks"" (1992), ""Forest Warrior"" (1996), ""The President's Man"" and its sequel (2002). Norris made his last film appearance to date in Sylvester Stallone's ""The Expendables 2"" (2012).

Throughout his film and TV career Norris diversified from his regular endeavors. He is a noted writer, having penned books on martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christianity, western novels, and biography. He was twice a New York Times bestselling author, first with his book on his personal philosophy of positive force and the psychology of self-improvement based on personal anecdotes called ""The Secret of Inner Strength: My Story"" (1988). His second New York Times Best Seller, ""Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America"" (2008), was about his critique on current issues in the USA. Norris also appeared in several commercials endorsing several products most notably being one of the main spokespersons for the Total Gym infomercials. In 2005, Norris found a new fame on the Internet when Chuck Norris facts became an Internet meme documenting humorous, fictional and often absurd feats of strength and endurance. Although Norris himself did not produce the ""facts"", he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated ""Chuck Norris facts"" in advertising, the phenomenon resulted in six books (two of them ""New York Times"" best sellers), two video games, and several appearances on talk shows, such as ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" where he read the facts or participated in sketches.","user

"Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist (in jazz and popular music). Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal and popular music styles such as pop, rock and electronic dance music.

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual as part of music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre).

"Southwark Bridge Road is a road in Southwark, London, England, between Newington Causeway near Elephant and Castle and Southwark Bridge across the River Thames, leading to the City of London, in a meandering route.

The road was created by connecting a series of other streets to provide access from the south to Southwark Bridge in 1819, which as a private venture was not able to use the publicly financed road system which had been created to improve access from the south to the City and the Westminster areas by the building of Westminster Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge in the late 18th Century which junction of routes combine at St George's Circus. This connection did not come about until the creation of Southwark Street in the 1880s. It does not start at the main northern roads junction at Elephant and Castle either.

At the southern end is the campus of London South Bank University. The Ministry of Sound, a well-known nightclub, is in Gaunt Street, just to the east, and is faced with Two Fifty One, a new mixed-used high-rise building, the construction of which generated issues for the club.

The London Fire Brigade Museum and the London Fire Brigade Training Centre were located on the road before the site started to be redeveloped in 2015.

"Johann Baptist Gänsbacher (8 May 1778 – 13 July 1844), Austrian musical composer, was born in 1778 in Sterzing in the County of Tyrol.

His father, a schoolmaster and teacher of music, undertook his son's early education, which the boy continued under various masters until 1802, when he became the pupil of the celebrated Abbé G. J. Vogler.

To his connection with this artist and with his fellow pupils, more perhaps than to his own merits, Gänsbacher's permanent place in the history of music is due; for it was during his second stay with Vogler, then (1810) living at Darmstadt, that he became acquainted with Weber and Meyerbeer, and the close friendship which sprang up among the three young musicians, and was dissolved by death only, has become celebrated in the history of their art. But Gänsbacher was himself by no means without merit.

In 1823-24, he was one of the 50 composers who composed a variation on a waltz by Anton Diabelli for ""Vaterländischer Künstlerverein"".

He creditably filled the responsible and difficult post of director of the music at St. Stephen's Cathedral, from 1823 until his death in Vienna; and his compositions show high gifts and accomplishment.

"Schisandraceae is a family of flowering plants with 3 known genera and a total of 92 known species (Luo et al., 2018 [open access] list all known species with their geographic occurrence). Such a family has been recognized by most taxonomists, at least for the past several decades. Before that, the plants concerned were assigned to family Magnoliaceae and Illiciaceae.

The APG IV and APG III systems of taxonomy recognize this family and place it on the order Austrobaileyales.

The APG II system, of 2003, also recognizes such a family. It places the family in order Austrobaileyales, which in turn is accepted as being among the most basic lineages in the clade angiosperms. APG II assumes this to be a family of three genera, the Schisandraceae ""sensu lato"". This family consists of woody plants, containing essential oils.

However, APG II does allow the option of segregating the genus ""Illicium"" as the family Illiciaceae. This leaves only two genera in the family Schisandraceae ""sensu stricto"", consisting of ""Schisandra"" and ""Kadsura"", totalling several dozen species, which are found in tropical to temperate regions of East and Southeast Asia and North America.

The APG system, of 1998, recognized both the families Schisandraceae ""sensu stricto"" and Illiciaceae, unplaced as to order. It regarded both families as being among the most basic lineages in the clade angiosperms.

The Cronquist system, of 1981, treated the plants in the family (in its wider sense) as two separate families, which together constituted 
: the order Illiciales,
:: in subclass Magnoliidae,

    Schisandraceae is a family of flowering plants with 3 known genera and a total of 92 known species (Luo et al., 2018 [open access] list all known species with their geographic occurrence). Such a family has been recognized by most taxonomists, at least for the past several decades. Before that, the plants concerned were assigned to family Magnoliaceae and Illiciaceae.

The APG IV and APG III systems of taxonomy recognize this family and place it on the order Austrobaileyales.

The APG II system, of 2003, also recognizes such a family. It places the family in order Austrobaileyales, which in turn is accepted as being among the most basic lineages in the clade angiosperms. APG II assumes this to be a family of three genera, the Schisandraceae ""sensu lato"". This family consists of woody plants, containing essential oils.

However, APG II does allow the option of segregating the genus ""Illicium"" as the family Illiciaceae. This leaves only two genera in the family Schisandraceae ""sensu stricto"", consisting of ""Schisandra"" and ""Kadsura"", totalling several dozen species, which are found in tropical to temperate regions of East and Southeast Asia and North America.

The APG system, of 1998, recognized both the families Schisandraceae ""sensu stricto"" and Illiciaceae, unplaced as to order. It regarded both families as being among the most basic lineages in the clade angiosperms.

The Cronquist system, of 1981, treated the plants in the family (in its wider sense) as two separate families, which together constituted

"The Chola dynasty was a Tamil thalassocratic empire of southern India, one of the longest-ruling dynasties in the world's history. The earliest datable references to the Chola are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE left by Ashoka, of the Maurya Empire (Ashoka Major Rock Edict No.13). As one of the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam, along with the Chera and Pandya, the dynasty continued to govern over varying territory until the 13th century CE. Despite these ancient origins, the period when it is appropriate to speak of a ""Chola Empire"" only begins with the medieval Cholas in the mid-9th century CE. 

The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the Kaveri River, but they ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their power from the later half of the 9th century till the beginning of the 13th century. The whole country south of the Tungabhadra was united and held as one state for a period of three centuries and more between 907 and 1215 AD. Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I, Rajadhiraja Chola, Virarajendra Chola, and Kulothunga Chola I, the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia. The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by naval raids on cities of the city-state of Srivijaya, as well as by the repeated embassies to China. The Chola fleet represented the zenith of ancient Indian sea power.

During the period 1010–1153, the Chola territories stretched from the islands of the Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh. Rajaraja Chola conquered peninsular South India, annexed parts of which is now Sri Lanka and occupied the islands of the Maldives. Rajendra Chola sent a victorious expedition to North India that touched the river Ganges and defeated the Pala ruler of Pataliputra, Mahipala. In 1025, he also successfully invaded cities of Srivijaya of Malaysia and Indonesia. Chola invasion ultimately failed to install direct administration over Srivijaya, since the invasion was short and only meant to plunder the wealth of Srivijaya. Chola rule or influence on Srivijava would last until 1070 when the Cholas began to lose almost all of its overseas territories. The Later Cholas (1070-1279) would still rule portions of Southern India. The Chola dynasty went into decline at the beginning of the 13th century with the rise of the Pandyan dynasty, which ultimately caused their downfall.

The Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of Tamil literature and their zeal in the building of temples has resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture. The Chola kings were avid builders and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centers of economic activity. They were also well known for their art, specifically temple sculptures and 'Chola bronzes', exquisite bronze sculptures of Hindu deities built in a lost wax process they pioneered; that continues (to a certain extent) to this day. They established a centralized form of government and a disciplined bureaucracy. The Chola school of art spread to Southeast Asia and influenced the architecture and art of Southeast Asia. The medieval Cholas are best known for the construction of the magnificent Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur, commissioned by the most famous Chola king, Rajaraja Chola in 1010 CE.","user

"Józef Bilczewski (26 April 1860 – 20 March 1923) was a Polish Roman Catholic prelate who served as the Archbishop of Lviv from 1900 until his death. He served as a theological and dogmatics professor in the Lviv college after himself having earned two doctorates in the course of his own studies. He earned a reputation as a learned and cultured man; these qualities led to Emperor Franz Joseph I nominating him for the Lviv archdiocese as its head. Pope Leo XIII named him as its archbishop and he set to work prioritizing a range of different pastoral initiatives aimed at revitalizing the faith within people and also prioritizing ecumenical cooperation with other denominations.

Bilczewski aided his people throughout the onslaught of World War I organizing relief and food for those displaced and those who became refugees; he likewise aided beggars and the homeless in his archdiocese. In 1918 he did all he could to smooth tensions during the Polish-Ukrainian War and he collaborated with his brother bishops in helping their people when the conflict escalated; he likewise did the same thing during the Bolshevik occupation of Poland and Ukraine while also collaborating with the apostolic nuncio Achille Ratti - the future Pope Pius XI.

His cause for sainthood commenced in 1944 and he became titled as a Servant of God while the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue allowed for him to be named as Venerable on 18 December 1997.

    Józef Bilczewski (26 April 1860 – 20 March 1923) was a Polish Roman Catholic prelate who served as the Archbishop of Lviv from 1900 until his death. He served as a theological and dogmatics professor in the Lviv college after himself having earned two doctorates in the course of his own studies. He earned a reputation as a learned and cultured man; these qualities led to Emperor Franz Joseph I nominating him for the Lviv archdiocese as its head. Pope Leo XIII named him as its archbishop and he set to work prioritizing a range of different pastoral initiatives aimed at revitalizing the faith within people and also prioritizing ecumenical cooperation with other denominations.

Bilczewski aided his people throughout the onslaught of World War I organizing relief and food for those displaced and those who became refugees; he likewise aided beggars and the homeless in his archdiocese. In 1918 he did all he could to smooth tensions during the Polish-Ukrainian War and he collaborated with his brother bishops in helping their people when the conflict escalated; he likewise did the same thing during the Bolshevik occupation of Poland and Ukraine while also collaborating with the apostolic nuncio Achille Ratti - the future Pope Pius XI.

His cause for sainthood commenced in 1944 and he became titled as a Servant of God while the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue allowed for him to be named as Venerable on 18 December 1997. The confirmation of a 1995 miraculous healing enabled Pope John Paul II to preside over Bilczewski's beatification in Lviv on 26 June 2001 while the recognition of another allowed Pope Benedict XVI to canonize him on 23 October 2005 in Saint Peter's Square.

"Arthur Prentice Rugg (August 20, 1862 – June 12, 1938) was a Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from 1906 to 1938, serving as Chief Justice from 1911 to 1938. He was appointed by Governor Eugene Foss.

Rugg was born on August 20, 1862 in the town of Sterling, Massachusetts. He was one of five children of Prentice Mason Rugg and Cynthia Ross Rugg. Rugg attended and graduated from Lancaster High School in 1879, then from Amherst College in 1883 and finally from the Boston University School of Law in 1886. He was admitted to the bar in 1886.

Immediately after admittance, Rugg established his practice in Worcester, Massachusetts with John R. Thayer. During this time, Rugg was involved in a number of political organizations. He was a member of Sterling's school committee from 1887. From 1888 to 1890 he was a trustee of the Sterling public library. He was a member of the Worcester city council in 1894 and was president of the group the next year.

In 1889, Rugg married Florence May Belcher. They had three children: sons Charles Belcher and Arthur Prentice Jr. and daughter Sidney H. Writ.

Rugg was elected city solicitor of Worcester in 1897. From this position, Massachusetts governor Curtis Guild Jr. appointed him to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court as an associate justice on September 14, 1906. On September 13, 1911, Massachusetts governor Eugene Foss nominated Rugg to be Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Rugg was the youngest person ever to receive that position.

He served on the court until his death, at his home in Sterling. He died of pneumonia.

Rugg received five honorary LL.D. degrees from schools in Massachusetts: Amherst College in 1908; Harvard University in 1914; Boston University in 1923; Williams College in 1924; Boston College in 1938.","user

"The Society of 1789 (French: ""Club de 1789""), or the Patriotic Society of 1789 (French: ""Société patriotique de 1789""), was a political club of the French Revolution inaugurated during a festive banquet held at Palais-Royal in May 13th 1790 by more moderate elements of the Club Breton. At their height of influence, it was the second most important club after the Jacobin Club.

Among its members were Jean Sylvain Bailly, Mayor of Paris; Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, commander-in-chief of the National Guard; François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, Isaac René Guy le Chapelier, Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord and Nicolas de Condorcet.

The club kept an apartment in Palais-Royal where banquets were held. Its members were considered moderate and preferred for France to remain a constitutional monarchy in opposition to the republicans.

The popularity of the club eventually decreased the same year as it was founded and the remaining audience went to form the Club des Feuillants, founded 18 July 1791.","user

"Madaram Brahma was an Indian poet and dramatist, who wrote in the Bodo language, a Sino-Tibetan language spoken by the Bodo people. Born in a Bodo family in 1903 at Kokrajhar in Dundhunikhata (present day Dhubri District) of the Northeast Indian state of Assam, he passed the matriculation from the local Government High School in Dhubri. His career started as a teacher and by 1932, he became the Headmaster of the Harisingha High School, Darang. In 1945 he joined the local administration, eventually becoming the first person of Bodo ethnicity to become a Block Development Officer.

Brahma wrote several poems, songs including hymns and plays which started with ""Boroni Gudi Sibsa Arw Aroj"", a book of hymns and prayers written in Bodo language. His other works included ""Khonthai Methai"" (Poems and Lyrics–1923), ""Boroni Gudi Sipsa Arw Aroj"" (Bodo Hymn and Prayer Songs–1926), Raimali (Drama–1926), ""Dimapur Nwgwr Bainai"" (The fall of Dimapur, drama), ""Sadang Bairagi"" (Sadang, The Sanyasi, drama), ""Rupesri Raithai Khantai"" (Rupesri- Poems and Prose–1988) and ""Phangseao Bibar Barnwi"" (Two Flowers in the Branch). Some of his works are prescribed texts for school curriculum and civil services examination. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1988.

Madaram Brahma died, aged 87, on 6 September 1990, at Rupnath Brahma Civil Hospital in his native place. A local school, ""Padmasri Madaram Brahma Mes School"" is named after him.","user

It is the successor to the HTC One Mini 2 in the Worldwide; but in global markets, it was sold alongside the One M9 as a mid-range offering. It was launched as an effort to improve the revenue of HTC's smartphone business after the failure of the One M9.

It features a unibody aluminum frame with a Super AMOLED HD display and Dolby Surround sound for headphones. It also features a fingerprint sensor which can be used to unlock the phone. It is the first non-Nexus device to be pre-installed with Android Marshmallow and the first non-CDMA phone that is compatible to work with the Verizon network in the United States.

It received mixed reviews following its release. While many critics lent specific praise to its construction and fingerprint scanner, other aspects have generally received indifferent or mixed reception. Some thought that its price point was too high, while others thought it was a clone of the iPhone 6. In November 2015, HTC reported a 15 percent increase in overall revenue.","user

"The , started at the beginning of the Neolithic in Japan, continued through the Bronze Age, and towards its end crossed into the Iron Age.

"Kind of Blue is a studio album by American jazz trumpeter-composer Miles Davis. It was recorded on March 2 and April 22, 1959, at Columbia's 30th Street Studio in New York City, and released on August 17 of that year by Columbia Records. For the recording, Davis led a sextet featuring saxophonists John Coltrane and Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley, pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb, with new band pianist Wynton Kelly appearing on one track – ""Freddie Freeloader"" – in place of Evans.

In part owing to Evans' joining the ensemble in 1958, Davis departed further from his early work's hard bop style in favor of greater experimentation with musical modes, as he had on his previous album ""Milestones"" (1958). In basing ""Kind of Blue"" entirely on modality, he gave each performer a set of scales that encompassed the parameters of their improvisation and style, and consequently more creative freedom with melodies. Coltrane later expanded on this modal approach in his solo career.

""Kind of Blue"" has been regarded by many critics as the greatest jazz record, Davis's masterpiece, and one of the best albums of all time. Its influence on music, including jazz, rock, and classical genres, has led writers to also deem it one of the most influential albums ever recorded. The album was one of fifty recordings chosen in 2002 by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, and in 2003 it was ranked number 12 on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

Though precise figures have been disputed, ""Kind of Blue"" is often cited as the best-selling jazz record of all time. In 2019, it was certified 5× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over five million copies.","user

It is typically due to either ""Staphylococcus aureus"" or ""Streptococcus pyogenes"". Risk factors include attending day care, crowding, poor nutrition, diabetes mellitus, contact sports, and breaks in the skin such as from mosquito bites, eczema, scabies, or herpes. With contact it can spread around or between people. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and appearance.
Prevention is by hand washing, avoiding people who are infected, and cleaning injuries. Treatment is typically with antibiotic creams such as mupirocin or fusidic acid. Antibiotics by mouth, such as cephalexin, may be used if large areas are affected. Antibiotic-resistant forms have been found.
Impetigo affected about 140 million people (2% of the world population) in 2010. It can occur at any age, but is most common in young children.

"Beverly Hills, 90210 (often referred to by its short title, 90210) is an American teen drama television series created by Darren Star and produced by Aaron Spelling under his production company Spelling Television. The series ran for ten seasons on Fox from October 4, 1990, to May 17, 2000, and is the first of six television series in the ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" franchise. The series follows the lives of a group of friends living in the upscale and star-studded community of Beverly Hills, California, as they transition from high school to college and into the adult world. ""90210"" refers to one of the city's five ZIP codes.

The initial premise of the show was based on the adjustment and culture shock that twins Brandon (Jason Priestley) and Brenda Walsh (Shannen Doherty) experienced when they and their parents, Jim (James Eckhouse) and Cindy (Carol Potter), moved from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Beverly Hills, California. In addition to chronicling the characters' friendships and romantic relationships, the show addressed topical issues such as sex, date rape, homophobia, animal rights, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, eating disorders, antisemitism, racism, teenage suicide, teenage pregnancy, and AIDS.

After poor ratings during its first season, the series gained popularity during the summer of 1991, when Fox aired a special ""summer season"" of the show while most other series were in reruns. Viewership increased dramatically, and ""90210"" became one of Fox's top shows when it returned that fall. The show became a global pop culture phenomenon with its cast members, particularly Jason Priestley and Luke Perry, who became teen idols; the series also made actresses Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth household names in the United States. The show is credited with creating or popularizing the teen soap genre that many other successful television shows followed in the years to come.

The show had many cast changes; Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling, Brian Austin Green, and Ian Ziering were the only actors to appear during its entire run and appeared on the first episode of the spin-off ""Melrose Place"".

On February 27, 2019, it was announced that a six-episode reboot has been ordered by Fox and that the show would simply be titled ""BH90210"". On May 8, 2019, it was announced that the reboot would premiere on August 7, 2019, at 9/8c on Fox.","user

The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Gilleleje.

Græsted-Gilleleje municipality ceased to exist due to ""Kommunalreformen"" (""The Municipality Reform"" of 2007). It was combined with Helsinge municipality to form the new Gribskov municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 278 km² and a total population of 40,409 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Hovedstaden (""Capital Region"").

"St Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in London, the capital of the United Kingdom. As the seat of the Bishop of London, the cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. It sits on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the City after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard being the site of St Paul's Cross.

The cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights of London. Its dome, framed by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome remains among the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom after Liverpool Cathedral.

Services held at St Paul's have included the funerals of Admiral Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher; jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer; the launch of the Festival of Britain; and the thanksgiving services for the Silver, Golden and Diamond Jubilees and the 80th and 90th birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II. St Paul's Cathedral is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz.
The cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services. The tourist entry fee at the door is £20 for adults (August 2020, cheaper online), but no charge is made to worshippers attending advertised services.

The nearest underground station is St. Paul's, which is away from St Paul's Cathedral.","user

"Silly Symphony was a series of 75 animated musical short films produced by Walt Disney Productions from 1929 to 1939. As their name implies, the ""Silly Symphonies"" were originally intended as whimsical accompaniments to pieces of music. As such, the films usually had independent continuity and did not feature continuing characters, unlike the ""Mickey Mouse"" shorts produced by Disney at the same time (exceptions to this include ""Three Little Pigs"", ""The Tortoise and the Hare"", and ""Three Orphan Kittens"", which all had sequels). The series is notable for its innovation with Technicolor and the multiplane motion picture camera, as well as its introduction of the character Donald Duck making his first appearance in the Silly Symphony cartoon ""The Wise Little Hen"" in 1934. Seven shorts won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

The series also spawned a Disney media franchise that included the ""Silly Symphony"" newspaper comic strip distributed by King Features Syndicate, the Dell comic book series ""Silly Symphonies"", as well as several children's books, many of which were based on ""Silly Symphony"" cartoons.

The ""Silly Symphonies"" returned to theatres with its re-issues and re-releases, and eventually tied with Joseph Barbera and William Hanna's ""Tom and Jerry""'s record for most Oscar wins for a cartoon series in the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film category. ","user

"George Armstrong Custer (December 5, 1839 – June 25, 1876) was a United States Army officer and cavalry commander in the American Civil War and the American Indian Wars.

Custer graduated from West Point in 1861 at the bottom of his class, but as the Civil War was just starting, trained officers were in immediate demand. He worked closely with General George B. McClellan and the future General Alfred Pleasonton, both of whom recognized his qualities as a cavalry leader, and he was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers at age 23. Only a few days after his promotion, he fought at the Battle of Gettysburg, where he commanded the Michigan Cavalry Brigade and despite being outnumbered, defeated J. E. B. Stuart's attack at what is now known as the East Cavalry Field. In 1864, Custer served in the Overland Campaign and in Philip Sheridan's army in the Shenandoah Valley, defeating Jubal Early at Cedar Creek. His division blocked the Army of Northern Virginia's final retreat and received the first flag of truce from the Confederates, and Custer was present at Robert E. Lee's surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox.

After the war, Custer was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army and was sent west to fight in the Indian Wars. On June 25, 1876, while leading the 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana Territory against a coalition of Native American tribes, he was killed along with all of the five companies he led after splitting the regiment into three battalions. This action became romanticized as ""Custer's Last Stand"".
His dramatic end was as controversial as the rest of his career, and reaction to his life and career remains deeply divided. Custer's legend was partly of his own fabrication through his extensive journalism, and perhaps more through the energetic lobbying of his wife Elizabeth Bacon ""Libbie"" Custer throughout her long widowhood.","user

"The Panavia Tornado is a family of twin-engine, variable-sweep wing multirole combat aircraft, jointly developed and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom and West Germany. There are three primary Tornado variants: the Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) fighter-bomber, the suppression of enemy air defences Tornado ECR (electronic combat/reconnaissance) and the Tornado ADV (air defence variant) interceptor aircraft.

The Tornado was developed and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and Aeritalia of Italy. It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979–1980. Due to its multirole design, it was able to replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) became the only export operator of the Tornado in addition to the three original partner nations. A tri-nation training and evaluation unit operating from RAF Cottesmore, the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment, maintained a level of international co-operation beyond the production stage.

The Tornado was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Italian Air Force, and RSAF during the Gulf War of 1991, in which the Tornado conducted many low-altitude penetrating strike missions. The Tornados of various services were also used in The Bosnian War, Kosovo War, Iraq War, in Libya during the 2011 Libyan civil war, as well as smaller roles in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. Including all variants, 990 aircraft were built.","user

"The Holland Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel under the Hudson River. It connects Lower Manhattan in New York City to the east with Jersey City in New Jersey to the west. An integral conduit within the New York metropolitan area, the Holland Tunnel is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The tunnel carries Interstate 78; the New Jersey side is also designated the eastern terminus of Route 139. The Holland Tunnel is one of three vehicular crossings between Manhattan and New Jersey, the others being the Lincoln Tunnel and the George Washington Bridge.

Plans for a fixed vehicular crossing over the Hudson River were first devised in 1906. However, disagreements prolonged the planning process until 1919, when it was decided to build a tunnel under the river. Construction of the Holland Tunnel started in 1920, and it opened in 1927. At the time of its opening, the Holland Tunnel was the longest continuous underwater vehicular tunnel in the world.

The Holland Tunnel was originally known as the Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel or the Canal Street Tunnel. It was renamed the ""Holland Tunnel"" in memory of Clifford Milburn Holland, the chief engineer, following his sudden death in 1924 before the tunnel was opened. The Holland Tunnel was the world's first mechanically ventilated tunnel; the ventilation system was designed by Ole Singstad, who oversaw the tunnel's completion.","user

"The Second Battle of Boulou (29 April to 1 May 1794) was a battle in the War of the Pyrenees, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. This battle saw the French Army of the Eastern Pyrenees led by Jacques François Dugommier attacking the joint Spanish-Portuguese Army of Catalonia under Luis Firmín de Carvajal, Conde de la Unión. Dugommier's decisive victory resulted in the French regaining nearly all the land they lost to the Kingdom of Spain in 1793. Le Boulou is on the modern A9 highway, south of the department capital at Perpignan and north of Le Perthus on the France-Spain border.

The spring of 1794 found the Spanish army holding a slice of French territory south of the Tech River and north of the Pyrenees. The Spanish right wing on the Mediterranean coast was separated from the center and left wing by a mountainous gap. First, Dugommier mounted a successful feint with his right wing that drew Spanish troops away from the center. Then he launched powerful French forces into the gap. These forces circled behind the Spanish center and forced their adversaries to retreat across a difficult mountain pass.

"Jan Pietraszko (7 August 1911 - 2 March 1988) was a Polish Roman Catholic bishop who served as one of the auxiliaries for the Kraków archdiocese and Titular Bishop of Turrisblanda from 1962 until his death. Pietraszko was a noted spiritual director and chaplain as well as a popular confessor but was best known for his sermons and for his homiletic writings. He did his ecclesial studies just before World War II broke out and was a brief hostage of the Gestapo after the Nazi forces invaded Poland in 1939. He later came under the watch of the communist secret service following the conflict for his attempt to see new churches constructed and church art and architecture preserved.

The process for his beatification opened in 1994 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause culminated on 21 December 2018 after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue which enabled for Pietraszko to be titled as Venerable.","user

"The ACTS Gigabit Satellite Network was a pioneering, high-speed communications satellite network in the years 1993-2004, created as a prototype system to explore high-speed networking of digital endpoints. The system was jointly sponsored by NASA and ARPA, implemented by BBN Technologies and Motorola, and was inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame in April 1997.

The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) network was designed to provide fiber-compatible SONET service to remote nodes and networks through a wideband satellite system, and provided long‐haul, point‐to‐point and point‐to‐multipoint full‐duplex SONET services, at rates up to 622 Mbit/s, over NASA's Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS).

The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite itself, built and operated by Lockheed Martin, was launched on STS-51 on September 12, 1993, by the Space Shuttle Discovery, and occupied a geostationary orbit at 100° west longitude. It was the first communication satellite to operate in the 20-30 GHz frequency band (Ka-Band), with 30 GHz uplink and 20 GHz downlink signals. The satellite incorporated advanced on-board switching and multiple dynamically-hopping spot-beam antennas for selected areas of the United States including Hawaii. Up to 3 uplink and 3 downlink antenna beams could be active simultaneously.

The ACTS network ground terminals were transportable Gigabit Earth Stations (GES) with fiber-optic SONET interfaces (OC-3 and OC-12), which also supported the Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) protocol suite. The network control and management functions are distributed in the various Gigabit Earth Stations, with the operator's interface being centralized in a Network Management Terminal (NMT), which could be collocated at a GES, or anywhere in the Internet. 

The system was operational and used for experiments for 127 months, instead of the originally planned 24-48 months. In all, 53 terminals were built and used by more than 100 experimenters to test ACTS abilities. In Nov. 1997 a record data rate of 520 Mbit/s TCP/IP throughput was achieved using ATM between several ground stations via ACTS. On May 31, 2000 the ACTS experiments program officially came to a close, but the system continued to support experiments until it was deactivated on April 28, 2004.","user

"The Statue of Metjen is on display in the Egyptian Museum in Berlin and has the inventory number ÄM 1106. The statue was discovered at Abusir in Metjen's mastaba by the Egyptian expedition (1842–1845) under the direction of the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius. The statue and the mastaba were bought to the museum in Berlin. The statue is an early example of an Egyptian statue belonging to a private individual. Metjen lived at the end of the Third and the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty (around 2600 BC). The statue is made of granite and about 47 cm high. It is datable under king Snofru.

Metjen is shown sitting on a chair. His right hand forms a fist and is placed on the chest, the left hand is placed on the leg. Metjen wears short curly hair. On the sides of the chair are inscriptions providing Metjen's name and his titles. The statue was once placed in the serdab of the mastaba and was therefore only visible via a small hole in the wall.

The statue belongs to the small group of private statues datable to the Egyptian Third Dynasty and earliest Fourth Dynasty. They are all made of hard stone and appear somehow clumsy and heavy. The statue of Metjen is the latest one of them. The statue belongs therefore stylistically between those of the Third Dynasty and those of the Fourth Dynasty. Its head is slightly too large, the small dimensions and the hieroglyphic texts in raised relief connects the statue with the Third Dynasty. Typical for the Fourth Dynasty are the positions of the hands and the chair, that does no longer copies a real chair as in the Third Dynasty.","user

"Colt Defender Mark I was an American multi-barreled shotgun intended for law enforcement or military use, completed in 1967. The shotgun was essentially a volley gun with eight single-shot barrels — each chambered for the 20-gauge 3-inch magnum shell — arranged in a octagonal fashion around the central axis, and could fire eight individual times like a semi-automatic action without the complexity of actually being a semi-automatic firearm. The action ran on a revolver-like rotating striker mechanism. The gun had a detachable buttstock and a pistol grip with a double-action trigger, and had a separate foregrip up front for instinctive shooting. 

The shotgun was extremely simple to operate and very robust. The designer, Robert Hillberg, thoroughly tested the weapon before seeking out a manufacturer. The design proved to be so correct, that only a couple of minor changes were made for manufacturing. When Colt Industries was contacted, they showed considerable interest in producing the weapon, but before committing to full production they insisted on a market survey to see if there was an adequate market for the gun. Colt demonstrated the weapon to a number of departments, and all who saw it were impressed with its compactness, volume of fire and reliability. However, the national recession at that time did not allow any adoption of the weapon and by 1971 the project was over.

The weapon was composed of an aluminum alloy receiver with steel inserts and was covered in an epoxy paint finish. The final version of the weapon was available in 4 variants. The first variant was a simplified one, with no special features. The second variant incorporated a barrel selector on the rotating striker on the hammer that allowed the shooter to select any one of the eight barrels, meaning that the weapon could be loaded with a variety of ammunition and the shooter could choose the most appropriate round for the given situation. The third variant contained a receptacle for a tear gas canister among the barrels, and pressing the trigger on the foregrip allowed the shooter to spray the target with tear gas, giving him a non-lethal option. The fourth and final variant had both the barrel selector and the tear gas canister.","user

"Azolla primaeva is an extinct species of ""water fern"" in the family Salviniaceae known from Eocene fossils from the Ypresian stage (), found in southern British Columbia.

The species was first described from poorly preserved material collected in the Similkameen River area near Princeton, British Columbia and later noted from outcrops at Stump Lake northeast of Princeton. The fossils were described by David P. Penhallow in the 1890 volume ""On Fossil Plants from the Smilkameen Valley and Other Places in the Southern Interior of British Columbia"". Though the volume only lists John William Dawson as author, Dawson notes that the ""A primaevum"" description had been written by Penhallow. Due to the poor nature of the type specimen the species was placed in the form genus ""Azollophyllum"" as ""Azollophyllum primaevum"" indicating its similarity to the modern genus, but at the same time acknowledging lack of detail needed to confirm its placement in the genus.

Placement of the species was formally changed with the publication of a paper written by Chester A. Arnold based on new fossil specimens collected near the former mining camp of Ashnola, British Columbia, approximately 8 miles south of Princeton along the Similkimeen River. The fossils were recovered from strata of the Allenby Formation, at the time considered Oligocene age, but now known to be of the Early Middle Eocene.

The specimens were studied by Arnold of the University of Michigan who published the 1955 type redescription for ""A. primaeva"" in the ""Contributions from the Museum of. Paleontology, University of Michigan"", Volume 12. Arnold noted the new specimens to consist of leafy vegetation and roots often forming mats in the rock. The plants are accompanied by microspore massulae and megasporangia.

At the time this paper was published, four species of ""Azolla"" had been described from the fossil record. The oldest species at that time was ""A. intertrappea"" from Eocene age strata in India and described in 1934 by Birbal Sahni and H. S. Rao. Also in 1934, Roland W. Brown described a similarly aged species, ""A. berryi"", from the Middle Eocene Green River Formation. An Oligocene species, ""A. prisca"", was published from the London Clays of England eight years earlier in 1926 by Marjorie E.J. Chandler and Eleanor M. Reid. The youngest of the fossil species was ""A. tertiaria"" described by Edward W. Berry in 1927 from Pliocene fossils found in the Esmeralda Formation of Nevada. Arnold notes that with the placement of ""A. primaeva"" into the genus ""Azolla"" means that its description in 1890 was actually the earliest species described from the fossil record.

After comparing the new fossil specimens to both modern and fossil species as much as he was able with the descriptions available, Arnold noted ""A. primaeva"" to be close in morphology to the living ""A.filiculoides"" and the Eocene ""A. intertrappea"" of India. Fossil specimens of ""Azolla"" have been recovered from the closely related strata of the Klondike Mountain Formation around Republic, Washington, but have not been described to species.","user

"The Circuit des Champs de Bataille was a multiple-stage road bicycle race held in northern France, Belgium and Luxembourg between 28 April and 11 May 1919. The race was composed of seven stages, with the first stage starting in and the last stage finishing in Strasbourg, a city in Alsace that with the end of hostilities had again become part of France. The stages took the race to Luxembourg City, Brussels, Amiens, Paris, Bar-le-Duc and Belfort. The race was approximately long, with riders covering around per day, with a rest day in between each stage. 

The race was organised by the newspaper ""Le Petit Journal"" as a means of reinvigorating bicycle racing in the region following World War I, to honour those who died in the war and for publicity purposes for the newspaper. It was announced on 5 January 1919, less than two months after the armistice of 11 November 1918. Although Europe was in the midst of reconstruction and then at the height of the deadly flu pandemic, the ""Petit Journal""'s 8,500 franc purse, the equivalent of four years' wages for a typical working man, guaranteed that the race would attract top talent. The newspaper also organised a number of other sporting events during 1919, including a football tournament for the liberated regions, an air race, a cross-country running race, a swimming competition and a boxing match. Although 140 riders registered for the race, many could not train or muster basic equipment, leaving just 87 riders to start the race in Strasbourg, including the prominent riders Oscar Egg, Jean Alavoine, Ali Neffati (who wore a fez) and Paul Duboc, as well as future cycling champions Jules Vanhevel, Lucien Buysse and Albert Dejonghe. The race was won by the Belgian Charles Deruyter, who finished with a lead of 2 hours 25 minutes. He was reportedly so cold at the end of the third stage that he was unable to sign his name, having astonished observers at the finish line of the second stage by crossing in a full-length woman's fur coat that had been given to him by a spectator along the way.

Historian Christopher Thompson reports that of the 87 riders who started the race, only 13 successfully finished it. It has since been described as the toughest cycle race in history. World War I had reduced many of the towns and villages that the race passed through to rubble. ""Le Petit Journal"" reported on ""terrible weather, broken roads, freezing wind and icy conditions"". Some local newspapers had warned before the event that the roads were in such a poor condition as to be unsuitable, but the organisers argued that these conditions bestowed prestige on the race, citing military cyclists who used the same roads under machine-gun fire. Given only rudimentary directions, riders had to search through piles of rubble at various crossroads to find signage directing them to the next town; some former villages were discernable only by smears of red brick dust. As a result of shortages caused by the war, the competitors also had to deal with poor supplies of food and poor-quality tires. Newspapers including ""Le Petit Journal"" and ""L'Auto"" did not see the difficulties of the event as evidence of the state of post-war France, but rather celebrated the race's competitors as ""heroic survivors"" who symbolised national revival; some 67 professional French cyclists were known to have died during the conflict. Upon its completion, the event's organisers called it a ""victory ... for the French race"". The publication ""Vélo-Sport"" praised the Belgian participants as ""géants de courage et de volonté"" (""heroes of courage and willpower"") who had given the public ""lessons in vigour"".

A race of the same name was held again in 1920, but it was organised as a one-day race rather than a stage race. This event was won by the French rider Henri Pélissier.","user

    The Circuit des Champs de Bataille was a multiple-stage road bicycle race held in northern France, Belgium and Luxembourg between 28 April and 11 May 1919. The race was composed of seven stages, with the first stage starting in and the last stage finishing in Strasbourg, a city in Alsace that with the end of hostilities had again become part of France. The stages took the race to Luxembourg City, Brussels, Amiens, Paris, Bar-le-Duc and Belfort. The race was approximately long, with riders covering around per day, with a rest day in between each stage.

"The Regulation of Railways Act 1868 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is one of the Railway Regulation Acts 1840 to 1893. 

It was enacted following the first murder on the railways, that of Thomas Briggs by Franz Muller near Hackney in 1864. 

The Act made new provisions for:

* ensuring a method was available for allowing passengers to communicate with the train's guard, if the train was scheduled to travel more than 20 miles without stopping; 
* establishing a fine for passengers raising the alarm without due cause (warnings of this fact still routinely appear near train emergency alarms);
* removing trees near railway lines that might fall and block the train;
* a penalty for trespassing on the railway.

Despite the legislation, it was not until 1899 that internal emergency wires came to be used on the majority of trains.

The Act also made provision for the construction and working of a railway as a Light Railway, 'subject to such conditions and regulations as the Board of Trade may from time to time impose or make'. Section 28 of the Act laid down maximum permitted axle weights and specified that 'the regulations respecting the speed of trains shall not authorize a rate of speed exceeding at any time twenty-five miles an hour'. The Light Railways Act 1896 subsequently introduced more comprehensive legislation governing light railways.","user

Section 28 of the Act laid down maximum permitted axle weights and specified that 'the regulations respecting the speed of trains shall not authorize a rate of speed exceeding at any time twenty-five miles an hour'. The Light Railways Act 1896 subsequently introduced more comprehensive legislation governing light railways.

The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the office pairs into couples so that they may all be able to take advantage of a Valentine's Day discount at a mini-mall. After Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) returns from his boat trip, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) decides that she is going to break up with him so that she can be with Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), but Pete begins to doubt her. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) share lunch with Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos).

""Couples Discount"" received mixed reviews from television critics and was viewed by 4.15 million viewers and received 2.1/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ultimately ranked fourth in its timeslot. Despite this, ""The Office"" ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night.","user

"The Nauru reed warbler (), Acrocephalus rehsei, is a passerine bird endemic to the island of Nauru in the Pacific Ocean. It is one of only two native breeding land-birds on Nauru and it is the only passerine found on the island. It is related to other Micronesian reed warblers, all of which evolved from one of several radiations of the genus across the Pacific. Related warblers on nearby islands include the Carolinian reed warbler, with which the Nauru species was initially confused, and the nightingale reed warbler, which was formerly sometimes considered the same species.

A medium-sized warbler, the Nauru reed warbler has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays two or three white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means that it could be vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.","user

"The Turnbull Government was the federal executive government of Australia led by the 29th Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, from 2015 to 2018. It succeeded the Abbott Government, which brought the Coalition to power at the 2013 Australian federal election. The Government consisted of members of Australia's Liberal-Nationals Coalition. Turnbull took office by challenging his leader, Tony Abbott, in an internal leadership ballot. Warren Truss, the leader of the Nationals, served as Deputy Prime Minister until he retired in 2016 and was replaced by Barnaby Joyce. Joyce resigned in February 2018 and the Nationals' new leader Michael McCormack became Deputy Prime Minister. The Turnbull Government concluded with Turnbull's resignation ahead of internal leadership ballot which saw him succeeded as Prime Minister by Scott Morrison and the Morrison Government.

In mounting his 2015 public challenge for the leadership, Turnbull cited extended poor polling in Newspoll by the Abbott Government and said Australia needed a new style of ""economic leadership"". Turnbull appointed Morrison as Treasurer in an expanded ministry, promoting several key supporters. Julie Bishop remained as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Conservatives Tony Abbott, Eric Abetz and Kevin Andrews were sent to the backbench. Joe Hockey left Parliament. The Turnbull Government continued a number of Abbott Government initiatives, promising a plebiscite legalising same-sex marriage, concluding Abbott era initiatives on an anti-domestic violence campaign, funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme, signing a China free trade deal, and reforming Senate voting.

The April 2016 refusal of the Senate to pass the Government's bill to re-establish a watchdog for the construction industry provided Turnbull with a double dissolution trigger. An election was held on 2 July, and the government was returned with its majority in the House of Representatives reduced to one seat. The 2016 election saw a resurgence of the right wing Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, and discontented conservative Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi left the party and established the Australian Conservatives soon after.

    The Turnbull Government was the federal executive government of Australia led by the 29th Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, from 2015 to 2018. It succeeded the Abbott Government, which brought the Coalition to power at the 2013 Australian federal election. The Government consisted of members of Australia's Liberal-Nationals Coalition. Turnbull took office by challenging his leader, Tony Abbott, in an internal leadership ballot. Warren Truss, the leader of the Nationals, served as Deputy Prime Minister until he retired in 2016 and was replaced by Barnaby Joyce. Joyce resigned in February 2018 and the Nationals' new leader Michael McCormack became Deputy Prime Minister. The Turnbull Government concluded with Turnbull's resignation ahead of internal leadership ballot which saw him succeeded as Prime Minister by Scott Morrison and the Morrison Government.

In mounting his 2015 public challenge for the leadership, Turnbull cited extended poor polling in Newspoll by the Abbott Government and said Australia needed a new style of ""economic leadership"". Turnbull appointed Morrison as Treasurer in an expanded ministry, promoting several key supporters. Julie Bishop remained as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Conservatives Tony Abbott, Eric Abetz and Kevin Andrews were sent to the backbench. Joe Hockey left Parliament. The Turnbull Government continued a number of Abbott Government initiatives, promising a plebiscite legalising same-sex marriage, concluding Abbott era initiatives on an anti-domestic violence campaign, funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme, signing a China free trade deal, and reforming Senate voting.

The April 2016 refusal of the Senate to pass the Government's bill to re-establish a watchdog for the construction industry provided Turnbull with a double dissolution trigger. An election was held on 2 July, and the government was returned with its majority in the House of Representatives reduced to one seat. The 2016 election saw a resurgence of the right wing Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, and discontented conservative Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi left the party and established the Australian Conservatives soon after. The now elected Turnbull Government secured passage of the Registered Organisations and Australian Building and Construction Commission legislation. In 2017, it announced Federal funds for expansion of Snowy Hydro. In June 2017, it introduced the ""Gonski 2.0"" reforms to schools funding. Factional strains continued.

"Marsu Productions, or simply Marsu, is a publishing house and licensing and merchandising company located in Monaco, managing Franco-Belgian comics characters and copyright concerns, chiefly from the comics universe of André Franquin. The name Marsu refers to one of Franquin's best known characters the Marsupilami, but the company also handles the character universes of ""Gaston Lagaffe"", ""Le Petit Noël"", ""Les Monstres"", as well as François Walthéry's ""Natacha"" and ""Le P'tit bout d'chique"", and ""Léonid et Spoutnika"" by Yann and Philippe Bercovici among others.

Franquin, who had previously worked for the publishing house Dupuis, decided to leave his company and start his own in 1987. He brought along his own creations ""Marsupilami"" and ""Gaston Lagaffe"", and the company soon started 
launching a series of ""Marsupilami"" albums continuing publication of the character Franquin had created in 1952, while working on the series ""Spirou et Fantasio"" for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine ""Spirou"". Since Spirou and Fantasio weren't Franquin's own creations, the publisher Dupuis retained the rights to the characters. Several of the characters under Marsu management are however closely associated with this series, and ""Marsupilami"", ""Gaston Lagaffe"", and ""Le Petit Noël"" are to varying degrees spin-off series.

The first publication, ""La Queue du Marsupilami"" in 1987 with art by Batem and stories by Greg, launched its new series, which by 2007 had passed 20 issues. ""Natacha"" made the switch from Dupuis to Marsu in 1989 with the album ""Cauchemirage"", and ended serial production in ""Spirou"". In 1992, Franquin also added worldwide rights of ""Gaston Lagaffe"" to Marsu, a series he also created for ""Spirou"". The ""Marsupilami"" album numbered 0, ""Capturez un Marsupilami"", the only album featuring Franquin's seminal stories, was published in 2002, some time after Franquin's death in 1997.

In 2013, the publisher was bought up by its competitor Dupuis.","user

"Cantus Arcticus, Op. 61, is a 1972 orchestral composition by the Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara. It is one of his best-known works.

Subtitled ""Concerto for Birds and Orchestra"", it incorporates tape recordings of birdsong recorded near the Arctic Circle, and on the bogs of Liminka, in northern Finland.

The work is in three movements: ""The bog"" opens with a flute duet, after which the other woodwinds join in, followed by the birds. The second movement, ""Melancholy"", features a slowed-down recording of the song of the shore lark. The final movement, ""Swans migrating"", takes the form of a long crescendo for orchestra, with the sounds of whooper swans. At the end both birdsong and orchestra fade, as if into the distance.

""Cantus Arcticus"" was commissioned by the University of Oulu for its first doctoral degree ceremony and premièred on 18 October 1972 with Stephen Portman conducting.","user

"The Mariana dam disaster, also known as the Bento Rodrigues or Samarco dam disaster, occurred on 5 November 2015, when the Fundão tailings dam at the Germano iron ore mine of the Samarco Mariana Mining Complex near Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil, suffered a catastrophic failure, resulting in flooding that devastated the downstream villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo (40 km (25 mi) from Bento Rodrigues), killing 19 people. The extent of the damage caused by the tailings dam collapse is the largest ever recorded with pollutants spread along of watercourses.

The failure of the dam released 43.7 million cubic metres of mine tailings into the Doce River, causing a toxic brown mudflow to pollute the river and beaches near the mouth when it reached the Atlantic Ocean 17 days later. The disaster created a humanitarian crisis as hundreds were displaced and cities along the Doce River suffered water shortages when their water supplies were polluted.

The total impact of the disaster, including the reason for failure and the environmental consequences, are officially under investigation and remain unclear. The owner of the Bento Rodrigues dam, Samarco, was subject to extensive litigation and government sanctions. In 2016, charges of manslaughter and environmental damage were filed against 21 executives, including Samarco's former CEO and representatives from Samarco's owners, Vale and BHP Billiton, on its board of directors.

In contrast to the Board of Regents and the Board of Governors, which serve advancement and alumni affairs functions, respectively, as well as advisory roles to the President, the President and Directors of Georgetown College is the legal entity of the incorporated Georgetown University. The authority of the body is enumerated in the March 1, 1815 federal charter of Georgetown University passed by the Thirteenth United States Congress and signed by President James Madison.

"Stenopterygii are a superorder of ray-finned fish in the infraclass Teleostei. Their validity is somewhat doubtful, as the group was established to separate, out of a large group of closely related Teleostei, a mere two rather peculiarly autapomorphic orders at best. In some treatments, it is even monotypic.

As originally conceived, the ""Stenopterygii"" include the Ateleopodiformes and Stomiiformes. Sometimes, the former are removed to form a monotypic superorder Ateleopodomorpha. These lineages are moderately advanced teleosts, but each is uniquely adapted to a deep-water oceanic environment. Their plesiomorphies are similar to the Salmoniformes and other Protacanthopterygii, but plesiomorphic traits are no reliable indicator of a close relationship. Nonwithstanding, the ""Stenopterygii"" appear to be close relatives of the Protacanthopterygii. Some cladistic analyses find at least the Stomiiformes deep within the latter superorder.

It thus cannot be ruled out that the ""Stenopterygii"" are better included in the Protacanthopterygii. An alternative approach is to consider the entire group – ""Stenopterygii"", Protacanthopterygii, the monotypic superorders ""Cyclosquamata"", and perhaps the monotypic superorders ""Lampridiomorpha"" and ""Scopelomorpha"" – an unranked clade named Euteleostei. But this would probably require splitting up the Protacanthopterygii, so that each euteleost superorder would at most contain 2 orders (though most would be monotypic), as the relative placement of all these groups is not very well resolved. Such a profusion of monotypic taxa is generally rejected by modern taxonomy, if it is not absolutely required to adequately reflect phylogeny.

Moreover, owing to the uncertain relationships of the euteleosts to the less advanced Otocephala (which include the superorders Clupeomorpha and Ostariophysi) and the more advanced teleosts (e.g. Acanthopterygii), it may well be that the supposed ""clade"" is merely an evolutionary grade. Such a paraphyletic group would according to modern understanding not warrant a taxon name at all. In this case, a possible solution would be to expand the Protacanthopterygii to subsume all the small ""superorders"", and to treat the Euteleostei as including the Protacanthopterygii and their more ""modern"" relatives.","user

"Charles Pomerantz (c. 1896 – June 1, 1973) was a pest control expert and self-trained entomologist who played a pivotal role in identifying the etiology of a 1946 outbreak in New York City of what was later named rickettsialpox.

Pomerantz was born in Poland and came to the United States as a child. He grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where he attended P.S. 20. He had originally started in a business manufacturing ladies coats, but switched to pest control as a means of performing a greater service to the community.

After visiting an apartment complex in Queens where a series of people had become sick with unusual rashes, Pomerantz inspected the site and discovered the mites near the building's incinerator rooms and reported his findings to health officials. Visiting the stricken Kew Gardens, Queens complex with physician Robert Huebner, the two peeled back wallpaper to find the walls swarming with mites, so much so that tenants had described that ""the walls had movement"". Huebner's investigations on the site led to the conclusion that tenants had been bitten by a mite identified as ""Allodermanyssus sanguineus"", found on mice that infested the storerooms and incinerator areas in the buildings. Pomerantz was credited with identifying this as a zoonotic disease spread through mice and the mites that infested them. After culturing and isolating the organism in laboratory mice, the pathogen they named ""Rickettsia akari"" was identified as the ultimate cause of the disease now called rickettsialpox. The Department of Health announced a program to work with building owners to exterminate the mice that were the vector for the disease. Over 500 cases of the disease were diagnosed in New York City from 1947 to 1951.

Pomerantz spoke about the importance of rodent control in densely populated areas in a March 1949 lecture to students and faculty members of the Harvard School of Public Health. Pomerantz noted that many mite-born illnesses may be misidentified as chickenpox, hives or scabies, and that physicians and entomologists needed to be prepared for the symptoms of these illnesses spread by mites.

In 1949, Dr. Edward W. Baker of the United States Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine honored Pomerantz with the naming of a mite discovered in peach orchards in the Southern United States, calling it ""Pomerantzia charlesi"" in recognition of Pomerantz's work. A species of flea discovered in the Philippines was named for him in 1951 as ""Stivalius pomerantzi"".

    Charles Pomerantz (c. 1896 – June 1, 1973) was a pest control expert and self-trained entomologist who played a pivotal role in identifying the etiology of a 1946 outbreak in New York City of what was later named rickettsialpox.

"Adam Doboszyński was a soldier of the Polish Army, writer, anti-Semitic right-wing politician, and a social activist. Born in 1904 in Kraków, he was murdered by the Communist secret services in 1949, in the notorious Mokotów Prison in Warsaw.

Doboszyński was born in Kraków on 11 January 1904, in a noble family. His father Adam was a lawyer and a member of the Austrian Imperial Council. During the Polish-Soviet War, sixteen-year old Doboszyński volunteered to the 6th Regiment of Heavy Artillery in Kraków, serving for four months. After graduation from high school, Doboszyński went to study law at the University of Warsaw. He did not stay there long, moving to Free City of Danzig, to study at the ""Technische Hochschule der Freien Stadt Danzig"" (currently: Gdańsk University of Technology). He was an active member of Polish national organizations in Danzig in the 1920s. Among others, he was chairman of the ""Association of Gdańsk Academics Vistula"" and co-founded of the Brotherly Help of the Association of Polish Students. Doboszyński also participated in three Congresses of the International Conference of Students.

In 1925 he graduated from the ""Technische Hochschule"" with the diploma of construction engineer. In 1925 - 1927, Doboszyński continued his education at the Sciences Po in Paris, but was forced to quit his studies early due to his family's financial difficulties. After the return to Poland, he completed a course at the ""Officer Cadet Sapper School"" in Dęblin, after which Doboszyński was promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant in reserve. In the late 1920s, Doboszyński returned to his family real estate, located in the village of Chorowice near Kraków, where he wrote his first books. In 1928, he wrote a novel ""Słowo ciężarne"" (""Pregnant Word""). Also, he wrote ""Szlakiem Malthusa"" (""Following Thomas Robert Malthus""), and an unpublished drama ""Trans"" (""Trance""). Furthermore, Doboszyński was active in the local Polish landed gentry circles, holding the post of a secretary in Kraków Branch of the Association of Landowners (1929 - 1931).

In 1931, Doboszyński became a member of Camp of Great Poland and since then was associated with Polish right-wing, national movement. In 1933, during a trip to England, he met G. K. Chesterton, whose ideas greatly influenced the Polish activist. In 1934, he wrote a book ""Gospodarka narodowa"" (""National Economy""), which was enthusiastically welcomed by right-wing activists. The book was a great success, it was reprinted three times, fourth reprint was terminated by the outbreak of the war.

Doboszyński's view of Polish national economy was shaped by the works of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. His critique of liberal capitalism and collectivism was based on the teachings of the Roman Catholic church. Doboszyński argued that both capitalism and communism, seemingly so different from each other, were based on anti-Christian, materialistic outlook. His views of national economy were shaped by the teachings of St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. He criticized liberal capitalism, regarding it as immoral. He expressed the opinion that both liberal capitalism and communism were joined by collectivism, and in his opinion, both doctrines had the same root, which was materialistic outlook. According to his philosophy, communist destroyed the human existence, exploiting an individual in the name of the creation of utopia. The process of mindless industrialization and centralization of economy was evil in his view, contributing to the moral decline of societies and exploitation of humans.

According to Doboszyński, the alternative to liberal capitalism in Poland was the creation of a national society, which was able to defend the nation from the concentration of industry. The society should be built like a human organism, in which an individual should not feel alienated, but be supported by the family and the homeland. The basis of a new economic regime was to be trade corporations of both employers and employees. Also, stratification of society was to remain untouched.

In 1934, Doboszyński joined Kraków Branch of the National Party (Poland), in which he was responsible for propaganda. He was regarded as a skillful administration, who built party structures in the region. He traveled across Poland, giving speeches to the workers of industrial centers of Bielsko-Biała, Łódź, Częstochowa or Borysław. Furthermore, he created mobile libraries, which toured the country, presenting national camp publications to the readers. Doboszyński co-created ""Polish Labor"" trade unions, which remained under control of the National Party. He published a number of press articles, remaining in close contact with other activists of the party. Due to his activities, he was frequently harassed by the police, and was close to imprisonment at the infamous Bereza Kartuska prison.

On the night of 22-23 June 1936 Doboszyński carried out the so-called Raid of Myślenice. A group of national activists, commanded by him, seized control of the town of Myślenice, disarming a local police station and cutting telephone wires. Windows of several Jewish-owned businesses were broken, and goods from these stores were carried out to the main market square, where they were set on fire. The raid was a response to the killing of National Party politician Wawrzyniec Sielski, who had been shot by the police in February 1936. In the morning of June 23, Doboszyński's unit retreated from Myślenice. It was followed by the police forces, which twice clashed with the national activists, who were heading southwards, to the Czechoslovak border. Most activists were captured, two were killed in the clashes. Doboszyński himself decided to voluntarily surrender to the police on 30 June.

During the first interrogation, Doboszyński claimed that he was to be blamed for the raid. His trial began in Kraków on 14 June 1937, as one of the most famous political trials of the Second Polish Republic. Doboszyński claimed in court that he carried out the raid in protest of police terror of the Sanacja regime. He was acquitted by the jury, but the decision was protested by the Appellate Tribunal. In February 1938 in Lwów, Doboszyński was found guilty of only one charge: seizing weapons from police post. He was sentenced for three and half years, but was released in February 1939 due to deteriorating health. Doboszyński remained actively involved in politics in the last months of the Second Polish Republic. During the April 1939 Congress of the National Party, he supported Zygmunt Berezowski.

In September 1939, Doboszyński joined Polish Army as a volunteer. Wounded near Lwów, he managed to escape from German captivity to Hungary and finally to France and Great Britain. For his military heroism, he was awarded the Cross of Valour (Poland) and the Croix de Guerre. In the early 1940s, while in Great Britain, Doboszyński remained in the service as a colonel. At the same time, he continued his political activity, publicly criticizing the National Party and its chairman Tadeusz Bielecki for its submission to the government in exile of General Władysław Sikorski. He actively worked on the creation of a wide national - Catholic bloc of several political movements. Doboszyński continued promoting Catholic-based ideas of a nation and social regime. In 1941 - 1941, together with Father Stanisław Bełch he published ""I am a Pole"" magazine, in which he criticized General Sikorski for his pro-Soviet stance. In his opinion, Sikorski was a weak man, whose career was based on his affiliations with French politicians.

In April 1941 Doboszyński was sent to a camp of Sikorski's opponents, located on the Isle of Bute in Scotland. He remained there until January 1942. After release, he continued his critique of Sikorski. In February 1943 he published an open letter, urging President Władysław Raczkiewicz and General Kazimierz Sosnkowski to overthrow Sikorski. The letter was supported by several Polish circles, but Doboszyński was arrested and then expelled from the army.

Following the war, Doboszyński remained in London. He lived in poverty, with occasional help provided by his friends from former Polish Armed Forces. Despite these problems, he continued writing. In 1945, he wrote in English ""Economics of charity"", and two years later completed the ""Pocket Encyclopedia of Social Notions"", and ""Two Platforms of Nationalism"". He also translated into Polish G.K. Chesterton's ""A Short History of England"" and Christopher Hollins' ""Breakdown of Money"". Furthermore, he remained politically active, as a member of a group called the ""Generation of Independent Poland"", in which he promoted the creation of a federation of Central European states, as a counterbalance against the expansion of Russia and Germany. Doboszyński also supported the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations.

Doboszyński strongly opposed all kinds of uprisings, regarding them as unnecessary and pernicious to the Polish nation. In November 1943 he published a text ""The Economy of Blood"", in which he argued that any uprising, breaking out in occupied Poland, would be as tragic as Polish 19-th century, failed insurrections. He also opposed the Third World War against the Soviet Union, arguing that it would not result in Poland's independence.

In December 1946 Doboszyński secretly returned to Poland. He wanted to personally become acquainted with political, economical and social situation of the country. Also, he wanted to meet with leaders of anticommunist guerilla movement, to tell them that they should not expect any support from the West. By early 1947, he was openly traveling across the country, meeting with national and Catholic activists. His plan was to created a strong national-Catholic organization, which would eventually created a stronger Poland. His activities were closely monitored by the Communist agents, as most of his partners were arrested.

In early summer 1947, Doboszyński completed his last work, ""Half Way"", which contained his opinion on the situation of Poland, prognosis for the future and advice for the national movement. On 3 July 1947 he was arrested in Poznań. His investigation was personally carried out by Józef Różański, who tortured Doboszyński. On 18 June 1949 Doboszyński's show trial began in the Regional Military Court in Warsaw. Doboszyński was accused of cooperation with intelligence services of both Nazi Germany and the United States. On 11 July 1949 Doboszyński was sentenced to death, with Bolesław Bierut refusing to pardon him. The sentence was carried out on 29 August 1949. Doboszyński was shot in the back of the head, at the infamous Mokotów Prison. His symbolic grave is located at the Powązki Cemetery.","user

    Adam Doboszyński was a soldier of the Polish Army, writer, anti-Semitic right-wing politician, and a social activist. Born in 1904 in Kraków, he was murdered by the Communist secret services in 1949, in the notorious Mokotów Prison in Warsaw.

Doboszyński was born in Kraków on 11 January 1904, in a noble family. His father Adam was a lawyer and a member of the Austrian Imperial Council. During the Polish-Soviet War, sixteen-year old Doboszyński volunteered to the 6th Regiment of Heavy Artillery in Kraków, serving for four months. After graduation from high school, Doboszyński went to study law at the University of Warsaw. He did not stay there long, moving to Free City of Danzig, to study at the ""Technische Hochschule der Freien Stadt Danzig"" (currently: Gdańsk University of Technology). He was an active member of Polish national organizations in Danzig in the 1920s. Among others, he was chairman of the ""Association of Gdańsk Academics Vistula"" and co-founded of the Brotherly Help of the Association of Polish Students. Doboszyński also participated in three Congresses of the International Conference of Students.

In 1925 he graduated from the ""Technische Hochschule"" with the diploma of construction engineer. In 1925 - 1927, Doboszyński continued his education at the Sciences Po in Paris, but was forced to quit his studies early due to his family's financial difficulties. After the return to Poland, he completed a course at the ""Officer Cadet Sapper School"" in Dęblin, after which Doboszyński was promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant in reserve. In the late 1920s, Doboszyński returned to his family real estate, located in the village of Chorowice near Kraków, where he wrote his first books. In 1928, he wrote a novel ""Słowo ciężarne"" (""Pregnant Word""). Also, he wrote ""Szlakiem Malthusa"" (""Following Thomas Robert Malthus""), and an unpublished drama ""Trans"" (""Trance""). Furthermore, Doboszyński was active in the local Polish landed gentry circles, holding the post of a secretary in Kraków Branch of the Association of Landowners (1929 - 1931).

In 1931, Doboszyński became a member of Camp of Great Poland and since then was associated with Polish right-wing, national movement. In 1933, during a trip to England, he met G. K. Chesterton, whose ideas greatly influenced the Polish activist. In 1934, he wrote a book ""Gospodarka narodowa"" (""National Economy""), which was enthusiastically welcomed by right-wing activists. The book was a great success, it was reprinted three times, fourth reprint was terminated by the outbreak of the war.

Doboszyński's view of Polish national economy was shaped by the works of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. His critique of liberal capitalism and collectivism was based on the teachings of the Roman Catholic church. Doboszyński argued that both capitalism and communism, seemingly so different from each other, were based on anti-Christian, materialistic outlook. His views of national economy were shaped by the teachings of St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. He criticized liberal capitalism, regarding it as immoral. He expressed the opinion that both liberal capitalism and communism were joined by collectivism, and in his opinion, both doctrines had the same root, which was materialistic outlook. According to his philosophy, communist destroyed the human existence, exploiting an individual in the name of the creation of utopia. The process of mindless industrialization and centralization of economy was evil in his view, contributing to the moral decline of societies and exploitation of humans.

According to Doboszyński, the alternative to liberal capitalism in Poland was the creation of a national society, which was able to defend the nation from the concentration of industry. The society should be built like a human organism, in which an individual should not feel alienated, but be supported by the family and the homeland. The basis of a new economic regime was to be trade corporations of both employers and employees. Also, stratification of society was to remain untouched.

In 1934, Doboszyński joined Kraków Branch of the National Party (Poland), in which he was responsible for propaganda. He was regarded as a skillful administration, who built party structures in the region. He traveled across Poland, giving speeches to the workers of industrial centers of Bielsko-Biała, Łódź, Częstochowa or Borysław. Furthermore, he created mobile libraries, which toured the country, presenting national camp ideas. Doboszyński was a member of the National Party until 1936, when he left the party due to disagreements with its leadership.

In 1936 Doboszyński founded the ""National Committee for the Defense of the Republic"", which was a secret organization of the National Party. The Committee was responsible for the defense of the Republic against the threat of the communist revolution. Doboszyński was the chairman of the Committee. The Committee was active until 1939, when it was disbanded due to the outbreak of World War II.

In 1939 Doboszyński was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. After the war, he was released from the camp and returned to Poland. Doboszyński was a member of the National Committee of the National Union, which was a secret organization of the National Party. The Committee was responsible for the defense of the Republic against the threat of the communist revolution. Doboszyński was the chairman of the Committee. The Committee was active until 1939, when it was disbanded due to the outbreak of World War II.

Doboszyński was a member of the National Union until 1948, when he left the party due to disagreements with its leadership. Doboszyński was a member of the National Union until 1948, when he left the party due to disagreements with its leadership.

"Ängelby is a Swedish television drama series created by Johan Kindblom and Tomas Tivemark, first broadcast by SVT in 2015. The series, which premiered on 28 September 2015 on SVT1 and was broadcast on ITV Encore in the UK from 31 August 2016, follows Vera Fors (Mia Skäringer), an ordinary mother-of-two whose life is turned upside down by a tragic event. After her husband has an affair with another woman, Vera loses the job that her husband got her, and desperately seeking new employment, she responds to a job vacancy in Ängelby, a small remote suburban city.

As Vera seeks the opportunity to start a new life, she makes the decision to take the children and move to Ängelby. But on the way, tragedy strikes when Vera appears to hit and kill a teenage ice-hockey star. In shock, Vera runs from the crime scene, but when she reports the incident to the police the next day, she discovers the boy's body has disappeared. Despite the incident, Vera becomes determined to make a life for herself in Ängelby. However, she soon comes to realise that the boy's disappearance is just the beginning of a series of strange and unpleasant events to occur in Ängelby, forcing Vera to make the decision to get to the bottom of things.

SVT confirmed that following positive reception and strong international sales for the first series, a second series has entered production.","user

"The 2017 Six Nations Championship was the 18th series of the Six Nations Championship, the annual northern hemisphere rugby union championship. The tournament was also known as the RBS 6 Nations because of the tournament's sponsorship by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.

It was contested by defending champions England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Including the competition's previous iterations as the Home Nations Championship and Five Nations Championship, it was the 123rd edition of the tournament.

For the first time the 2017 tournament used the bonus point system common to most other professional rugby union tournaments. As well as the standard four points for a win and two for a draw, a team scoring four tries in a match received an additional league table point, as did a team losing by seven or fewer points. Additionally, to ensure that a team winning all of its five matches (a Grand Slam) would also win the Championship, three bonus points were to be awarded for this achievement.
For the second successive year, the championship was won by England with a round to spare.
However, they were denied the Grand Slam and Triple Crown in the final game by a defeat to Ireland in the final round, the fifth time this has happened to England in the Six Nations era (2000, 2001, 2011, 2013 and 2017) and the third time at the hands of the Irish (the other two being 2001 and 2011).","user

"Rudolf König (18 August 1865 – 30 January 1927) was an Austrian merchant, amateur astronomer and selenographer.

He was born in Vienna and received his technical education in Leipzig. After graduation, he went into his father's business. 

As he had an interest in astronomy, in 1906 he built a private observatory in Vienna, on the top of his house, 12 Kuppelwiesergasse. 

From this observatory, with a double Zeiss astrograph, he carried out many observations of the Moon.

In 1912 he published a volume of illustrations of the Moon made by his deceased friend Johann Krieger.

"Stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ""STIM2"" gene.

This gene is a member of the stromal interaction molecule (STIM) family which comprises only two members together with its homologue STIM1, and likely arose from a common ancestral gene. They encode type 1 transmembrane proteins that are located in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR / ER) into the cell. Alternative translation initiation from an AUG and a non-AUG (UUG) start site results in the production of two different STIM2 isoforms.

Both members of the STIM family were identified in 2005 as free-calcium (Ca2+) sensors which participate in a mechanism of Ca2+ entry into the cell referred to as store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Many cellular processes and signaling pathways are started by previous release of Ca2+ stored in subcellular organelles, which needs of a continuous refilling. SOCE is considered the mechanism of store refilling and an essential mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in non-electrically excitable cells. While STIM1 triggers SOCE, research on STIM2 function suggests a major role as feedback regulator that stabilizes basal cytosolic and S/ER Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]. STIM2 detects small decreases in Ca2+ content stored in the S/ER, switches to the activated state and interacts with so called store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels located in the plasma membrane, such as Orai or TRPC channels, allowing SOCE. Although the functional role of STIM2 has been elusive for many years, studies performed in 2009-2010 on murine models suggested that STIM2 participates in processes of the development and functioning of many cell types, including smooth muscle myoblasts, cells of the immune system and neurons, and is involved in tumorigenesis, the development of autoimmune diseases and mechanisms of neuronal damage after transient ischemic conditions.","user

"Bygrave is a village and civil parish in the North Hertfordshire district of Hertfordshire, England, about 2 miles north-east of Baldock. In the 10th century the parish was called Bigraffan and 11th to 16th centuries Bigrave. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 271. A reservoir is situated behind the Old Rectory and used for irrigation of potato crops by Manor Farm.

The village stands on a clay-capped hill, a defensive position where the original settlement was surrounded by moats built in 1386 which can still be seen today. From these defences, the whole parish bounded by Icknield Way, the Great North Road, the Cat Ditch and a ridge to the north would have been visible.

The village church is St Margaret's and is dedicated to St Margaret of Antioch, while the site on which it stands dates from at least Saxon times with two phases of Saxon construction from 8th-10th centuries. Some Romano-British pottery, pre-dating the present church by several centuries was found under the north nave wall indicating a much earlier settlement on this site. This church has carvings of the ancient game of Nine Men Morris on the frames of the chancel windows. There are wall paintings that date from the mid fifteenth century. A notable rector here was George Coke who went on to be the bishop of Hereford. The Church is open at weekends only and the key is available from the churchwardens.

The peaceful lane leading to the church was once the centre of a busy village and known as the Market Place and flourished between the 13th and 15th centuries. There was a 3-day annual fair beginning at the feast of St Margaret. The date was changed to Easter Monday and survived until Victorian days.

The Manor Farm has contributed much to the life of this village, from when most people living there were actually employed on the farm, to the present day. Sheep are still grazed on the Common.

There is also a tiny airfield used for microlight aircraft.","user

"Spaceway-2 is part of AT&T's constellation of direct broadcast satellites. The satellite was launched via an Arianespace Ariane 5 ECA rocket from Kourou, French Guiana on 16 November 2005. Its operational position is in geosynchronous orbit above the equator at 99.2° West longitude. Spaceway-2 is a Boeing 702-model satellite with a 12-year life expectancy. It is expected to support high-definition television to DirecTV customers with its Ka-band communications payload. Although Spaceway-2 was originally built by Boeing to be used for broadband Internet access via Hughes Network Systems, it has been retrofitted to deliver HD local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox) to numerous markets nationwide.

On 19 April 2006, the satellite was delivered to DirecTV's control after successful on-orbit testing. Spaceway-2 immediately started broadcasting HD locals to DirecTV customers in eight more markets: Minneapolis, Minnesota; Sacramento and San Diego, California; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Nashville, Tennessee; Kansas City, Missouri; Columbus, Ohio; and Birmingham, Alabama. Satellites named T10 (launched in 2007) and T11 (launched in 2008), constructed by Boeing, also for use in high-definition television, are bent-pipe Ka-band satellites instead of regenerative satellites, and are being used to continue the expansion of DirecTV's HD services.

Spaceway-2 was originally envisioned as a global Ka-band communications system.

Boeing retrofitted the Spaceway-2 satellite for bent-pipe Ka-band communications for use in high-definition television and disabled the regenerative on-board processing of the original system that was to be used for the Spaceway broadband satellite communications.

T11 is co-located with Spaceway-2 satellites in order to use the 500 MHz of unused spectrum for HDTV broadcasting. This spectrum was originally intended for the broadband internet capabilities of the two Spaceway satellites which were disabled by Hughes Network Systems at the request of DirecTV.","user

"Human rights in Kyrgyzstan improved after the ouster of President Askar Akayev in the 2005 Tulip Revolution and the installment of a more democratic government under Roza Otunbayeva. While the country is performing well compared to other states in Central Asia, many human rights violations still take place. Especially LGBT rights have been getting worse in recent years, freedom of press on the contrary has been improving.

The democratic performance of the country has been declining since 2014. Corruption is still an issue in the country although it has been steadily declining since 2008.

Formerly a republic of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan became independent in 1991. Remaining reasonably stable throughout most of the 1990s, the country's young democracy showed relative promise under the leadership of Akayev, but moved towards autocracy and authoritarianism by the early 2000s, achieving a 5.5 rating from Freedom House in 2000. In 2020 the country is considered ""partly free"" by Freedom House with a score of 39 out of 100.

In 2004, prior to the democratic revolution, Kyrgyzstan was rated by Freedom House as ""Not Free,"" with a 6 in Political Rights and 5 in Civil Liberties (scale of 1-7; 1 is the highest). This indicated marked regression, from a 4.3 rating a decade earlier in 1994. Although the 1993 Constitution defines the Kyrgyz Republic as a democratic republic, President Askar Akayev continued to dominate the government. Serious irregularities reportedly marred 2003 a national constitutional referendum as well as presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000.","user

In 2020 the country is considered ""partly free"" by Freedom House with a score of 39 out of 100.

In 2004, prior to the democratic revolution, Kyrgyzstan was rated by Freedom House as ""Not Free,"" with a 6 in Political Rights and 5 in Civil Liberties (scale of 1-7; 1 is the highest). This indicated marked regression, from a 4.3 rating a decade earlier in 1994. Although the 1993 Constitution defines the Kyrgyz Republic as a democratic republic, President Askar Akayev continued to dominate the government. Serious irregularities reportedly marred 2003 a national constitutional referendum as well as presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000.

"Bomberman Legends, also known as Jaguar Bomberman, is an unreleased action-maze video game that was in development by Genetic Fantasia and planned to be published by Atari Corporation for the Atari Jaguar. It was going to be a unique entry in the ""Bomberman"" franchise, featuring its own dedicated single-player and multiplayer modes, with the latter having support for up to eight players by using two Team Tap adapters.

The idea of creating a ""Bomberman"" title for the Jaguar was primarily hatched by Genetic Fantasia, which was a development company that was formed by Mike Mika, along with his colleagues to Atari Corp. during a behind-the-scenes meeting at Las Vegas in 1994, with the team looking at ""Super Bomberman 2"" in order to replicate its gameplay mechanics on the system.

Though Atari acquired the license of ""Bomberman"" from Hudson Soft between 1994 and 1995, the project would be discontinued by the former sometime in 1996 along with other upcoming projects for the platform such as ""Black ICE\White Noise"" and ""Thea Realm Fighters"", due to Atari preparing to drop support for the Jaguar before merging with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on April of the same year. ""Bomberman Legends"" was never previewed or mentioned in magazines and other publications at the time when the title was still being developed, until its existence was revealed during an online Q&A session hosted by ""Next Generation"" on April 1998. The game was also thought to be lost, before its source code was eventually recovered in recent years by two of the original programmers of the title.","user

"""Kiss It Better"" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna for her eighth studio album, ""Anti"" (2016). It was written and produced by Jeff Bhasker and Glass John, with additional writing by Teddy Sinclair and Rihanna. The song was serviced to radio stations in the United States on 30 March 2016 together with ""Needed Me"". ""Kiss It Better"" is a pop, synth-rock and R&B ballad, which features influences from the 1980s and 1990s-music ballads. The song's lyrics focus on a destructive relationship that the singer finds irresistible. It also deals with themes of mending broken fences and getting back together with a lover.

The single received critical acclaim, with critics praising its '80s throwback, lyrics, and Rihanna's vocals. It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Song at the 59th ceremony. ""Kiss It Better"" peaked at number 62 on the US ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also reached number four on the South African radio chart. The song's music video was directed by fashion photographer Craig McDean and premiered on March 31, 2016. The video was inspired by dadaism and surrealism, and depicts Rihanna against a dark background. The song was included on the Anti World Tour setlist as the closing song.

In January 2021, the song gained notoriety again on radio and TikTok with the release of rapper Fat Joe’s single, ""Sunshine (The Light)"" featuring DJ Khaled and amorphous. The song heavily samples the first verse of ""Kiss It Better"" as its chorus, using Rihanna’s vocals.","user

New York, 432 U.S. 197 (1977), was a legal case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States that stated that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause did not prevent the burdening a defendant with proving the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance as defined by New York law.

The court found that the State of New York had reclassified provocation (""extreme emotional disturbance"") as an excuse (an affirmative defense requiring proof by preponderance of the evidence), rather than a circumstance negating the mental element (mens rea), which the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as was the situation in ""Mullaney v.

"Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five was an American hip hop group formed in the South Bronx of New York City in 1978. The group's members were Grandmaster Flash, Melle Mel, The Kidd Creole (not to be confused with Kid Creole), Keef Cowboy, Scorpio and Rahiem. The group's use of turntablism, breakbeat DJing, and conscious lyricism were significant in the early development of hip hop music.

In the late 1970s, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five built their reputation and achieved local success by performing at parties and live shows. By 1980, the group had signed with Sugar Hill Records. Under Sugar Hill Records, the group rose to prominence in the early 1980s with their first hit ""Freedom"". It was not until the release of the song ""The Message"" in 1982 and the album of the same name that they achieved mainstream success. The song provided a political and social commentary and went on to become a driving force behind conscious hip-hop.

Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five split into two separate groups, due to differences, until a brief reunion in 1987 led to the release of the original line-up's second album ""On the Strength"". Afterwards, they disbanded permanently. Today, the group's legacy continues as Grandmaster's Furious Five with only Melle Mel and Scorpio as remaining members.

The group are widely regarded as one of the greatest groups of all time. They were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2007; the first hip hop group to be inducted. In 2002, its first year of archival, ""The Message"" was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. ""Rolling Stone"" ranked ""The Message"" number 51 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004.","user

"Fikret Mashadi Jamil oghlu Amirov (; November 22, 1922, Ganja – February 20, 1984, Baku) was a prominent Azerbaijani composer of the Soviet period.

Fikret Amirov grew up in an atmosphere of Azerbaijani folk music. His father, Mashadi Jamil Amirov, was a famous mugam singer (""xanəndə""), who played tar and composed, including the 1915 opera ""Seyfal mulk"".

During his childhood and early adolescence, Fikret began composing pieces for the piano. Upon his graduation from the Ganja Music College, Amirov entered the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire, now known as the Baku Music Academy, where he was a student of Boris Zeidman and Uzeyir Hajibeyov.

In 1941, when Nazi Germany attacked the USSR, Amirov, 19 at the time, was drafted to the Soviet army. He was wounded near Voronezh, hospitalized and demobilized from the military service, returning to Baku to continue his studies at the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire.

Amirov's music was strongly influenced by Azeri folk melodies. He created a new genre called symphonic mugam. Amirov's symphonic mugams were based on classical folk pieces and were performed by many renowned symphony orchestras throughout the world, such as the Houston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski.

Amirov was a prolific composer. His most famous pieces include symphonic works such as ""Shur"" (1946), ""Kurd Ovshari"" (1949), ""Azerbaijan Capriccio"" (1961), ""Gulustan Bayati-Shiraz"" (1968), ""The Legend of Nasimi"" (1977), ""To the Memory of the Heroes of the Great National War"" (1944), ""Double Concerto for Violin, Piano and Orchestra"" (1948) etc.

His ballets include ""Nizami"" (1947) and ""Arabian Nights"", which premiered in 1979. Amirov wrote the opera ""Sevil"" in 1953.

He also wrote a number of pieces for the piano including ""Ballad,"" ""Ashug's Song,"" ""Nocturne,"" ""Humoreska,"" ""Lyrical Dance,"" ""Waltz,"" ""Lullaby"" and ""Toccata."" He also wrote numerous film scores.

Michelle Kwan, World Champion Ice Skater from the U.S. used Fikret Amirov's symphonic piece ""Gulustan Bayati-Shiraz"" in her skating program ""Taj Mahal"" in 1996.","user

"Outer space is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is . The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins. Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is ""dark energy"", a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.

Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. The Kármán line, an altitude of above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.

Humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high-altitude balloon flights. This was followed by crewed rocket flights and, then, crewed Earth orbit, first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961. Due to the high cost of getting into space, human spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon. On the other hand, uncrewed spacecraft have reached all of the known planets in the Solar System.

Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and radiation. Microgravity also has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.","user

    Outer space is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is . The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins. Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is ""dark energy"", a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.

Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. The Kármán line, an altitude of above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.

"The Treaty of Nystad (; ; ; ) was the last peace treaty of the Great Northern War of 1700–1721. It was concluded between the Tsardom of Russia and the Swedish Empire on in the then Swedish town of Nystad (, in the south-west of present-day Finland). Sweden had settled with the other parties in Stockholm (1719 and 1720) and in Frederiksborg (1720).

During the war Peter I of Russia had occupied all Swedish possessions on the eastern Baltic coast: Swedish Ingria (where he began to build the soon-to-be new Russian capital of St. Petersburg in 1703), Swedish Estonia and Swedish Livonia (which had capitulated in 1710), and Finland.

In Nystad, King Frederick I of Sweden formally recognized the transfer of Estonia, Livonia, Ingria, and Southeast Finland (Kexholmslän and part of Karelian Isthmus) to Russia in exchange for two million silver thaler, while Russia returned the bulk of Finland to Swedish rule.

The Treaty enshrined the rights of the German Baltic nobility within Estonia and Livonia to maintain their financial system, their existing customs border, their self-government, their Lutheran religion, and the German language; this special position in the Russian Empire was reconfirmed by all Russian Tsars from Peter the Great (reigned 1682-1725) to Alexander II (reigned 1855-1881).

Nystad manifested the decisive shift in the European balance of power which the war had brought about: the Swedish imperial era had ended; Sweden entered the Age of Liberty, while Russia had emerged as a new empire.","user

"STS-2 was the second Space Shuttle mission conducted by NASA, and the second flight of the orbiter ""Columbia"". The mission launched on 12 November 1981 and landed two days later on 14 November. STS-2 marked the first time that a crewed, reusable orbital vehicle returned to space. This mission tested the Shuttle Imaging Radar as part of the OSTA-1 payload, along with a wide range of other experiments including the Shuttle robotic arm, commonly known as Canadarm. Other experiments or tests included Shuttle Multispectral Infrared Radiometer, Feature Identification and Location Experiment, Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites, Ocean Color Experiment, Night/Day optical Survey of Lightning, Heflex Bioengineering Test, and Aerodynamic Coefficient Identification Package (ACIP). One of the feats accomplished was various tests on the OMS including starting and restarting the engines while in orbit and various adjustments to its orbit. The OMS tests also help adjust the Shuttle's orbit for use of the radar. During the mission, President Reagan called the crew of STS-2 from Mission Control in Houston.

In the early planning stages of the Space Shuttle program, STS-2 was intended to be a reboost mission for the aging Skylab space station. However, such a mission was impeded by delays with the Shuttle's development and the deteriorating orbit of Skylab. Skylab ultimately de-orbited on 11 July 1979, two years before the launch of STS-2.","user

"Lancelot du Lac (French for Lancelot of the Lake), also written as Launcelot and other variants (such as early German ""Lanzelet"", early French ""Lanselos"", early Welsh ""Lanslod Lak"", Italian ""Lancillotto"", Spanish ""Lanzarote del Lago"", and Welsh ""Lawnslot y Llyn""), is a character in some versions of Arthurian legend, where he is typically depicted as King Arthur's close companion and one of the greatest Knights of the Round Table. In the French-inspired Arthurian chivalric romance tradition, Lancelot is the orphaned son of King Ban of the lost kingdom of Benwick, raised in the fairy realm by the Lady of the Lake. A hero of many battles, quests and tournaments, and famed as a nearly unrivalled swordsman and jouster, Lancelot becomes the lord of Joyous Gard and personal champion of Arthur's wife Queen Guinevere. But when his adulterous affair with Guinevere is discovered, it causes a civil war that is exploited by Mordred to end Arthur's kingdom.

His first appearance as a main character is found in Chrétien de Troyes' poem ""Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart"", written in the 12th century. Later, his character was expanded upon in other works of Arthurian romance, especially the vast ""Lancelot-Grail"" prose cycle that presented the now-familiar version of his legend following its retelling in ""Le Morte d'Arthur"". There, Lancelot's and Lady Elaine's son Galahad, devoid of his father's flaws of character, becomes the perfect knight and succeeds in completing the greatest of all quests by retrieving the Holy Grail after Lancelot himself fails due to his sins.","user

"The Portage Lakes are a group of glacial kettle lakes and reservoirs in Northeast Ohio. The name comes from an old Indian portage path that connected the Cuyahoga River flowing north to Lake Erie and the Tuscarawas River, a tributary of the Muskingum River, which flows south to the Ohio River. This proved advantageous for the Indians and early settlers as navigation from Lake Erie to the Ohio was possible with only an eight-mile portage. Portage Lakes State Park lies at one of the highest points of the state and on a major watershed divide in Ohio. Some water from the lakes reaches Lake Erie and some flows to the Ohio River.

There is an unincorporated community named Portage Lakes in Summit County, near Elevation: , in the area.

The area became an important trading post for settlers and Indians. It was a recognized landmark during the War of 1812, serving as a rendezvous point of American troops. The old Indian portage path was part of the ancient boundary between the Six Nations and the Western Indians.

The city of Akron was laid out in 1825 and was first settled by Irish laborers and others working on the Ohio and Erie Canal. Once the canal was completed, the town flourished. Several important industries brought prosperity to the area including stoneware potteries, sewer pipe manufacturing, the match industry and, most recently, the tire and rubber industry. At one time, the Blue Diamond Match Company in Akron used three million board feet (7,000 m³) of white pine lumber per year for the manufacture of its matches.

Several of the Portage Lakes were built as feeder reservoirs for the canals to maintain the required depth of . The lakes were used for this purpose until the canals were abandoned in 1913. The lakes were then used to meet the water needs of the local industries. Some portions of the remnant canals in the Akron area can still be boated.

The Ohio Department of Public Works maintained the canal lands for recreational purposes until 1949 when the Portage Lakes were transferred to the newly formed Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Parks and Recreation.","user

Before 1 January 2010, it was known as Norwegian national road 774 ""(Riksvei 774)"", but control was transferred to the county so now it is a Norwegian county road ""(Fylkesvei)"".

"Queso flameado (Spanish for ""flamed cheese""; also queso fundido, ""melted cheese"" or choriqueso) is a dish of hot melted cheese and spicy chorizo that is often served flambé. Often compared to cheese fondue, it is a party dish; it is popular at cookouts and in restaurants as an appetizer. Almost unique in Mexican cuisine, in the cuisine of the United States this dish has been widely adapted and is considered a native dish in El Paso. In Mexico, it occurs in restaurants more often in the north.
Typical main ingredients are melted cheese and a characteristic meat sauce of loose fresh chorizo, tomato, onion, chile and spices. It is served in a small, shallow casserole or other ceramic or metal heat-proof baking dish. The cheese and sauce are prepared separately, and combined just before serving. This may be done at the table, especially if finished with a flambé: high alcohol liquor is poured on the cheese and ignited, and as it burns the server folds in the sauce. If not flambéed, the mixture may be quickly broiled. Either way, the finished dish is presented while it is still bubbling hot, and it is spooned onto small soft tortillas for individual servings.

""Queso flameado"" is said to originate in the borderlands of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, as a campfire dish.
In Tex-Mex restaurants, this dish is sometimes confused or conflated with chili con queso, a cheese sauce served with tortilla chips for dipping. The term ""queso fundido"" also refers to processed cheese and is defined as such in the Spanish version of Codex Alimentarius.","user

Originally trained as a lawyer, he was elected at the 1900 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Banffshire, and was re-elected in 1906. However he died in December that year from injuries received in a railway accident at Elliot Junction, forcing a by-election early in 1907.

"The Paradise Club is a BBC television crime drama series, broadcast between 19 September 1989 and 27 November 1990. The series starred Don Henderson and Leslie Grantham as Frank and Danny Kane, siblings who inherit a nightclub from their mother, Ma Kane, a matriarch of a criminal South London gang, after she tragically dies. At the start of the series, Frank is working as a priest but decides to return to London to steer his brother Danny away from crime. The series featured a large supporting cast, with Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden notably making an appearance in the episode ""Rock and Roll Roulette"". A total of 20 episodes were broadcast over the course of 2 series.

The series has never officially been released on DVD, due to issues surrounding clearance rights for the music used. Notably, the series has yet to be repeated on any of the BBC's co-owned free-to-air digital channels, such as UK Gold or UKTV Drama (it has been aired on UK Gold). However, both series are available to purchase from Amazon, but these are VHS to DVD transfers of the original broadcast, in varying quality. A soundtrack album of music featured in the series was also released in 1989, and was available on CD, LP and Cassette.","user

"Søren Skov (born 21 February 1954 in Nyborg) is a Danish former professional football player who played as a forward. Skov played for a number of clubs in Germany, Italy and Switzerland, but played most of his career for Belgian club Cercle Brugge. He has played three games for the Danish national team.

Born in Nyborg on Funen, Skov played his first years in Funen clubs Nyborg BK and Odense BK. He made his debut for the Danish under-21 national team in June 1975. Skov played four under-21 national team games and scored one goal from to June to October 1975. In 1975, Skov moved abroad to play professionally for German club FC St. Pauli in the secondary 2nd Bundesliga Nord league. He made his debut for St. Pauli in December 1975, and scored two goals in his first three games for the club. He only missed two games for the remainder of the 2nd Bundesliga Nord 1975–76 season, scoring a total four goals in 19 games as St. Pauli finished 14th. In his second year at St. Pauli, Skov scored seven goals in 34 games, as St. Pauli won the 2nd Bundesliga Nord 1976–77 league and was promoted into the top-flight 1st Bundesliga championship.

Skov did not represent St. Pauli in the 1st Bundesliga, as he subsequently moved to play for Cercle Brugge in the top-flight Belgian First Division championship. In his first season at Cercle, Skov scored three goals in 29 league games, as Cercle finished 17th of 18 teams, and were relegated to the Belgian Second Division. Skov stayed with Cercle and helped the club win the 1978–79 Second Division to bounce straight back into the First Division. In the next two seasons, Skov scored 19 goals in 62 games for Cercle. Skov's most successful season at Cercle was the 1981–82 First Division season, as he scored 23 goals in 33 games. Skov caught the eye of Danish national team coach Sepp Piontek, and Skov made his national team debut on 5 May 1982, in a 1–1 draw against Sweden. He played a further two national team games in May 1982.

In the Summer 1982, Skov moved to Italy to play for Avellino in the Serie A championship. Avellino finished 9th in the Serie A 1982–83 season. In 1983, Skov moved on to German club Hertha BSC in the 2nd Bundesliga. In his two seasons at Hertha, Skov scored seven goals in 48 games.

"NHL 17 is an ice hockey simulation video game developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports. It is the 26th installment in the ""NHL"" game series and was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in September 2016.

The development team focused solely on eighth generation console versions for ""NHL 17"", citing an increased player base on those consoles over seventh generation ones. They utilized Electronic Arts' Ignite engine and built the game off of that, attempting to generally improve on the series' previous installment. They introduced gameplay improvements in terms of artificial intelligence and physics as well as new mode such as the World Cup of Hockey tournament mode and a revamped version of ""Be a GM"", a simulation mode where the player acts as a team's general manager, titled ""Franchise Mode"", which now features team owners and team relocation. A newer Creation Zone was also added, featuring an expansive team builder as well as an arena creator. Modes from its predecessor saw a return as well, including the trading card-based team building mode Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT), the online co-operative play mode known as EA Sports Hockey League, and Be a Pro, a career mode. Similar to the past two ""NHL"" titles, ""NHL 17"" features presentation in the style of the ""NHL on NBC"".

Prior to the game's release, there were several trailers were released to promote it. A public beta for the game was initiated prior to the game's release for testing. Critics who played the beta wrote generally positive reviews and noted it as a good precursor to the full game. Upon full release, ""NHL 17"" received generally positive reviews from critics. The gameplay improvements and new additions to the game mainly received praise, while criticism was aimed at some lack of depth and general innovation.","user

"""Hated in the Nation"" is the sixth and final episode in the third series of the British science fiction anthology series ""Black Mirror"". Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by James Hawes, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, along with the rest of series three. It is the longest episode of ""Black Mirror"", at 89 minutes.

A Nordic noir-inspired episode, ""Hated in the Nation"" follows Detectives Karin Parke (Kelly Macdonald) and Blue Coulson (Faye Marsay) as they investigate a spate of deaths targeting the subjects of social media hatred, at the hands of Autonomous Drone Insects (ADIs) that have been deployed to combat environmental catastrophe as bees near extinction. It was filmed largely in London.

Informed by Brooker's experience of receiving hate mail after writing a 2004 ""Guardian"" column that disparaged George W. Bush, the episode drew comparison to ""The X-Files"" and explored themes including government surveillance and environmentalism. Across mostly positive reviews, critics praised the acting but gave mixed comments on the story and episode's length. It received middling rankings on ""Black Mirror"" instalments by quality.","user

"KA Commuter line Jakarta Kota–Tanjung Priok, or the Tanjung Priok line, is a commuter rail line in Indonesia, operated by PT Kereta Commuter Indonesia. The line connects Jakarta Kota station in West Jakarta and Tanjung Priuk station in North Jakarta. On maps and diagrams, the line is shown using the colour ""pink"" (). Covering a distance of only 15.37 kilometres, the pink line is the shortest line in the Jakarta KA Commuter system, and serves mostly as the connecting feeder line between Jakarta Kota station (red and blue line) and Kampung Bandan station (yellow line). The Pink Line traces its origins back to a railway line built from 1883–1885 during the Dutch colonial era, to connect the city of Jakarta to Tanjung Priok Port. It was also one of the earliest railway lines in Indonesia to be electrified starting from 1925.

"The Ural owl (""Strix uralensis"") is a large nocturnal owl. It is a member of the true owl family, ""Strigidae"". The Ural owl is a member of the genus ""Strix"", that is also the origin of the family’s name under Linnaean taxonomy. Both its common name and scientific name refer to the Ural Mountains of Russia where the type specimen was collected. However, this species has an extremely broad distribution that extends as far west as much of Scandinavia, montane eastern Europe, and, sporadically, central Europe, thence sweeping across the Palearctic broadly through Russia to as far east as Sakhalin and throughout Japan. The Ural owl may include up to 15 subspecies, but most likely the number may be slightly fewer if accounting for clinal variations. 

This forest owl is typical associated with the vast taiga forest in Eurosiberia, although it ranges to other forest types, including mixed forests and temperate deciduous forest. The Ural owl is something of a dietary generalist like many members of the ""Strix"" genus, but it is usually locally reliant on small mammals, especially small rodents such as voles. In terms of its reproductive habits, Ural owls tend to vigorously protect a set territory on which they have historically nested on a variety of natural nest sites, including tree cavities and stumps and nests originally built by other birds but now, in many parts of the range are adapted to nest boxes made by biologists and conservationists. Breeding success is often strongly correlated with prey populations. The Ural owl is considered to be a stable bird species overall, with a conservation status per the IUCN as a least concern species. Despite some local decreases and extinctions, the Ural owl has been aided in central Europe by reintroductions.","user

"Shenzhou 4 () – launched on December 29, 2002 – was the fourth uncrewed launch of the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. Two dummy astronauts were used to test the life support systems (a live astronaut was not used until Shenzhou 5 on October 15, 2003).

The spacecraft was equipped for a crewed flight, even featuring a sleeping bag, food, and medication. The windows were constructed of a new material that was designed to stay clear even after reentry to allow an astronaut to confirm that the parachutes have deployed properly. It was said that the spacecraft flown on Shenzhou 4 had no major differences to that used on Shenzhou 5. It flew with the ability for manual control and emergency landing, systems needed for a crewed flight. A week before the launch, astronauts trained in the spacecraft to familiarise themselves with its systems.

Initially the spacecraft was in a by orbit inclined at 42.4°. This was raised to by at 23:35 UTC on December 29, 2002. On January 4 and January 5, 2003 several smaller manoeuvres were thought to have taken place. The rate of orbital decay seemed higher after January 1, suggesting that the orbital module's solar panels may have been deployed for the first time. Compared to Shenzhou 3 the orbital period of Shenzhou 4 was much more tightly bounded with smaller manoeuvres.

The launch of Shenzhou 4 was watched by officials including Chairman of the National People's Congress Li Peng; Vice Premier and member of the Politburo Standing Committee Wu Bangguo; Jia Qinglin, also a member of the Standing Committee; Cao Gangchuan, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission; Song Jian, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; and Li Jinai, head of the General Armament Department of the People's Liberation Army. According to the weather forecast, the launch site was -29°C.

The spacecraft carried 100 peony seeds to investigate the effect of weightlessness on plants grown from them. The 52 experiments onboard investigated areas in physics, biology, medicine, earth observation, material science, and astronomy.

Four tracking ships were used for the mission — one off the coast of South Africa in the South Atlantic Ocean, one in the Indian Ocean near Western Australia, one in the North Pacific Ocean south of Japan, and one in the South Pacific Ocean west of New Zealand.

The reentry module landed safely about from Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. As with previous flights, the command for reentry to begin was given by a tracking ship off the coast of South Africa. It was thought before the flight that the Chinese would attempt a water landing to test the emergency system but this did not happen. The orbital module remained in orbit until September 9, 2003.","user

"Edgar Karl Alfons Ende (23 February 1901 – 27 December 1965) was a German surrealist painter and father of the children's novelist Michael Ende.

Ende attended the Altona School of Arts and Crafts from 1916 to 1920. In 1922 he married Gertrude Strunck, but divorced four years later. He remarried in 1929, the same year his son Michael was born. In the 1930s Ende's Surrealist paintings began to attract considerable critical attention, but were then condemned as degenerate by the Nazi government. Beginning in 1936 the Nazis forbade him to continue to paint or exhibit his work. In 1940 he was conscripted into the Luftwaffe as an operator of anti-aircraft artillery.

The majority of his paintings were destroyed by a bomb raid on Munich in 1944, making his surviving pre-war work extremely rare. In 1951, Ende met the recognized founder of Surrealism, André Breton, who admired his work and declared him an official Surrealist. He continued to paint surrealist works until his death in 1965 of a myocardial infarction.

Ende's paintings are thought to have had a significant influence on his son's writing. This is inferred in the scenes depicting the surreal dream-paintings from Yor's Minroud in ""Die Unendliche Geschichte"" (""The Neverending Story""), and is made explicit in Michael Ende's book ""Der Spiegel im Spiegel"" (""The mirror in the mirror""), a collection of short stories based on (and printed alongside) Edgar Ende's surrealist works.","user

"In combinatorics, the Dinitz theorem (formerly known as Dinitz conjecture) is a statement about the extension of arrays to partial Latin squares, proposed in 1979 by Jeff Dinitz, and proved in 1994 by Fred Galvin.

The Dinitz theorem is that given an ""n"" × ""n"" square array, a set of ""m"" symbols with ""m"" ≥ ""n"", and for each cell of the array an ""n""-element set drawn from the pool of ""m"" symbols, it is possible to choose a way of labeling each cell with one of those elements in such a way that no row or column repeats a symbol.
It can also be formulated as a result in graph theory, that the list chromatic index of the complete bipartite graph formula_1 equals formula_2. That is, if each edge of the complete bipartite graph is assigned a set of formula_2 colors, it is possible to choose one of the assigned colors for each edge
such that no two edges incident to the same vertex have the same color.

Galvin's proof generalizes to the statement that, for every bipartite multigraph, the list chromatic index equals its chromatic index. The more general edge list coloring conjecture states that the same holds not only for bipartite graphs, but also for any loopless multigraph. An even more general conjecture states that the list chromatic number of claw-free graphs always equals their chromatic number. The Dinitz theorem is also related to Rota's basis conjecture.","user

An even more general conjecture states that the list chromatic number of claw-free graphs always equals their chromatic number. The Dinitz theorem is also related to Rota's basis conjecture.

"St Mark's Campanile () is the bell tower of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Italy. The current campanile is a reconstruction completed in 1912, the historical tower having collapsed in 1902. At in height, it is the tallest structure in Venice and is colloquially termed ""el paròn de casa"" (the master of the house). It is one of the most recognizable symbols of the city.

Located in Saint Mark's Square near the mouth of the Grand Canal, the campanile was initially intended as a watchtower to sight approaching ships and protect the entry to the city. It also served as a landmark to guide Venetian ships safely into harbour. Construction began in the early tenth century and continued sporadically over time as the tower was slowly raised in height. A belfry and a spire were first added in the twelfth century. In the fourteenth century the spire was gilded, making the tower visible to distant ships in the Adriatic. The campanile reached its full height in 1514 when the belfry and spire were completely rebuilt on the basis of an earlier Renaissance design by Giorgio Spavento. Historically, the bells served to regulate the civic and religious life of Venice, marking the beginning, pauses, and end of the work day; the convocation of government assemblies; and public executions.

The campanile stands alone in the square, near the front of St Mark's Basilica. It has a simple form, recalling its early defensive function, the bulk of which is a square brick shaft with lesenes, wide on each side and tall. The belfry is topped by an attic with effigies of the Lion of St Mark and allegorical figures of Venice as Justice. The tower is capped by a pyramidal spire at the top of which there is a golden weather vane in the form of the archangel Gabriel.","user

"Apache HiveMind is an inversion of control (IOC) software project of the Apache Software Foundation written in Java. It takes the form of a services and configuration microkernel.

In HiveMind, a service is an implementation of a Java interface. Unlike other service-oriented architectures (SOAs), HiveMind is explicit about combining Java code within a single JVM.

The HiveMind project, formerly a top-level Apache project, was retired 22 April 2009, ending its life in the Apache Attic repository. Its successor is considered to be Tapestry IOC, a Guice-like IoC container for Java EE model–view–controller web applications.

    Apache HiveMind is an inversion of control (IOC) software project of the Apache Software Foundation written in Java. It takes the form of a services and configuration microkernel.

In HiveMind, a service is an implementation of a Java interface. Unlike other service-oriented architectures (SOAs), HiveMind is explicit about combining Java code within a single JVM.

The HiveMind project, formerly a top-level Apache project, was retired 22 April 2009, ending its life in the Apache Attic repository. Its successor is considered to be Tapestry IOC, a Guice-like IoC container for Java EE model–view–controller web applications. (Tapestry's requirement for IoC was the reason HiveMind was conceived in the first place.)

"John Bryson Chane (born May 13, 1944) is a bishop of the Episcopal Church. The eighth diocesan bishop of Washington, he was consecrated at Washington National Cathedral on June 1, 2002, leading the Episcopal Diocese of Washington until he retired in November 2011. During this time, he also served between June 2003 and April 2005 as interim dean of Washington National Cathedral. In his role as Episcopal Bishop of Washington, Chane served as president and CEO of the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation, which oversees the operations of Washington National Cathedral and the three cathedral schools: St. Alban's School for Boys, the National Cathedral School for Girls, and Beauvoir, the National Cathedral Elementary School.

""Washingtonian Magazine"" named him as one of the 150 most influential leaders in the District of Columbia. The ""Sunday Telegraph"" in London called him one of the most prominent leaders in the Anglican Communion.

A leader in global interfaith dialogue and study, Chane traveled to Iran on numerous occasions as the invited guest of former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. In late 2011, he was part of a four-person delegation that traveled to Tehran, and was instrumental in freeing the American hikers held in Evin Prison. He is one of the few from the West who has ever met with the current Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khameni.

Chane has participated as a presenter at conferences in Oslo and Tehran sponsored by the Oslo Center for Peace and Human Rights, the ""Club de Madrid"", and ""Le Dialogue des Civilizations"", focusing on religion, politics and terrorism, religion and politics and gender equality. He continues to work with the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., as a planner and presenter at the annual U.S. Islamic World Forum, held in Doha, Qatar.

He has spoken on numerous occasions at the Industrial College of The Armed Forces in Washington D.C., the U.S. Secretary of State's Open Forum and as the Anglican principal at the semi-annual Christian-Muslim Summit sponsored by Washington National Cathedral. A respected speaker and charismatic preacher, he has been invited on several occasions by the Chautauqua Institution of New York to serve as Preacher in Residence.

Chane has been the recipient of various awards, including D.C.'s Interfaith Bridge Builders Award, the George Washington University President's Medal, the Berea College Founder's Medal, Search for Common Ground's Award for Global Peace and Reconciliation, the Rumi Forum's Global Peace Award and the Yale Divinity School's Lux et Veritas Award. He was a contributing author to ""Iraq Uncensored"", an initiative of the bipartisan American Security Project,

On January 30, 2010, Chane announced his intention to retire as Episcopal Bishop of Washington, stepping down from that role in 2011. The ninth bishop, Mariann Edgar Budde, was consecrated and installed at Washington National Cathedral on November 12, 2011.","user

"Something/Anything? is the third album by American musician Todd Rundgren, released in February 1972. It was his first double album, and was recorded in late 1971 in Los Angeles, New York City and Bearsville Studios, Woodstock. Three quarters of the album was recorded in the studio with Rundgren playing all instruments and singing all vocals, as well as being the producer. The final quarter contained a number of tracks recorded live in the studio without any overdubs, save for a short snippet of archive recordings from the 1960s.

Rundgren had become confident enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards that he had tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles in an attempt to record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.

The album peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold three years after its release. A single taken from the album, ""Hello It's Me"", was a top-five hit in the US in late 1972, and it contained a further hit, ""I Saw the Light"". ""Something/Anything?"" later attracted critical acclaim as one of the most significant records of the 1970s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 173 on ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and later ranked at number 396 in the 2020 edition.
It was voted number 797 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's ""All Time Top 1000 Albums"" (2000). After ""Something/Anything"", Rundgren moved away from the straightforward pop ballads present on this album to more experimental territory and progressive rock in later releases, beginning with ""A Wizard, A True Star"".","user

"Richard Rapier Stokes, (27 January 1897 – 3 August 1957) was a British soldier and Labour politician who served briefly as Lord Privy Seal in 1951.

The second son of Philip Folliott Stokes and his wife Mary Fenwick Rapier, the only surviving child of Richard Christopher Rapier (1836-1897) of Ransomes & Rapier, Richard Stokes was educated at Downside School, the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and Trinity College, Cambridge. He served in the Royal Artillery during World War I, winning the Military Cross and bar and the Croix de Guerre. His uncle Sir Wilfred Stokes, chairman and managing director of the engineering firm Ransomes & Rapier invented the Stokes Mortar in World War I. His uncle Leonard Stokes was an architect who designed the new buildings at Downside School (built 1912, when Richard was at Downside). Richard Stokes was chairman (1939) and supporter of the School of Economic Science.

On going down from Cambridge he joined his family's business, Ransomes & Rapier, and was made managing director at the age of 30. When rearmament was proposed by the National Government Stokes offered to charge the nation cost price for all his firm's rearmament work. It was rejected by the National Government and shortly afterwards he joined the Labour Party. Though he held office under Labour governments he was said to have remained a backbencher at heart.

Stokes won the Ipswich seat in a 1938 by-election, which he kept in the 1945, 1950, 1951 and 1955 elections. He was known for his independence in parliament, including, with Bishop George Bell and fellow Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Alfred Salter, opposing area strategic bombing during World War II. Stokes was also a prominent critic of the inadequacy of Allied tank design. Prior to the war, he co-wrote a paper (with Andrew MacLaren and George Lansbury) analysing the economic forces menacing peace in Europe. After the RAF's bombing of Dresden on the night of 13 February and the early hours of 14 February 1945, his questions in the House about the act were in part responsible for the reappraisal of the Government's bombing policy in the last month of the war in Europe. He raised other issues after the war relating to Yalta and the forced repatriation of Yugoslavs, and the treatment of Dr George Chatterton-Hill in Germany.

Following the 1945 general election, Labour were returned to power. Stokes devoted much of his energy to the Friends of Ireland group, of which he was treasurer. He was appointed Lord Privy Seal and the new position of Minister of Materials in April 1951, succeeding Ernest Bevin but served only a few months before Labour lost the 1951 general election. He aimed to show that the proposed armaments programme could be carried out, contrary to Aneurin Bevan and Harold Wilson (who had resigned over this and other issues).

Stokes died at home on 3 August 1957 in London of a heart attack, according to his death notice. A few days before, on 23 July, he had been in a road accident when his car overturned during a thunderstorm on the flooded London road at Stanway near Colchester.","user

"Planetfall is a science fiction themed interactive fiction video game written by Steve Meretzky, and the eighth title published by Infocom in 1983. The original release included versions for Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, TRS-80, and IBM PC compatibles (both as a self-booting disk and for MS-DOS). The Atari ST and Commodore 64 versions were released in 1985. A version for CP/M was also released. Although ""Planetfall"" was Meretzky's first title, it proved one of his most popular works and a best-seller for Infocom; it was one of five top-selling titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions including in-game hints. Planetfall uses the Z-machine originally developed for the Zork franchise and was added as a bonus to the ""Zork Anthology"".

The word ""planetfall"" is a portmanteau of ""planet"" and ""landfall"", and occasionally used in science fiction to that effect. The book ""Planetfall"" written by Arthur Byron Cover, uses the game image on the cover, and is marketed ""In the bestselling tradition of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".""

"The IBM 1403 line printer was introduced as part of the IBM 1401 computer in 1959 and had an especially long life in the IBM product line. The original model could print 600 lines of text per minute and could skip blank lines at up to 75 inches per second (190 cm/s), while the model 3 could print at up to 1400 lines per minute. The standard model had 120 print positions. An additional 12 positions were available as an option. A print chain with up to 15 copies of the character set spun horizontally in front of the ribbon and paper. Hammers struck the paper from behind at exactly the right moment to print a character as it went by. In later models, the print chain was replaced by a print train; print slugs instead of being mounted on a chain were placed in a track.
The 1403 chain or train contained 240 characters, however numerous duplications allowed a line to be printed in less than the 0.4 s required for one full rotation. The original standard ""A"" chain contained 48 different characters, repeated five times each. A ""preferred character set"" variant used in later models printed the same 48 characters, but varied the number of appearances: 10 digits appeared eight times each, 26 upper-case letters appeared four times each, and 12 special characters codice_1 appeared eight (first four), four (middle four) or two (last four characters) times each.
Special chains or trains could be ordered for other character sets. Scientific users, for example, would use a chain that had the left parenthesis, the right parenthesis, and the plus sign in place of the per cent sign (%), the lozenge (⌑), and the ampersand (&). The numerics chain had 15 copies each of only 16 characters. The ""T"" chain for general text had two copies of 120 characters, including upper-and lower-case letters and numerous special symbols.

The ink ribbon was a long roll the width of the print area that was positioned between the print chain and the paper. The roll came in two parts, the feeder roll and take-up roll. The roll was constantly wound and rewound during printing.
Like most IBM printers of the era, the 1403 used fan-folded paper with perforated edges for tractor feeding. A carriage control tape or, later, a buffer, under program control, specified form length and the form line where printing was to begin so that paper of various sizes could be used.

An IBM 1403 printer played a cameo role in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 movie ""Dr. Strangelove"", serving as a hiding place for a portable radio.

The overstrike capability of the printer was used to generate a wide range of grey-scale equivalents. Many images were scanned, pixelated and could be reproduced on the 1403, most notably the Mona Lisa.

These were noisy machines, especially when the cover was raised. Some people were able to create text that used the timing of the print hammers to generate desired frequencies and actually play music when that text was printed.","user

"The River Corrib (Irish: ""Abhainn na Gaillimhe"") in the west of Ireland flows from Lough Corrib through Galway to Galway Bay.

"The Goulais River (Pronounced: goo-lee) is a river in northern Ontario, Canada, which rises in the Algoma highlands and empties into Goulais Bay on eastern Lake Superior near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. It is one of the largest tributaries on the eastern lake, draining an area of approximately .

The river and its tributaries were used to transport logs to local sawmills during the second half of the 19th century. The Algoma Central Railway travels up the river valley on its way to the Agawa canyon.

At one time, the river was an important spawning area for lake sturgeon. However, logging operations, fishing and the installation of an electric barrier to prevent sea lampreys from travelling upstream (removed in 1960) have reduced sturgeon activity in the river.

The river is used for recreational canoeing, kayaking, and swimming, and the headwaters and parts of the river have been protected by the Goulais River Provincial Park.

The river's name is thought to come from the French word ""goulet"" or ""narrow passage"", which is also the source of the English words ""gully"" and ""gullet"". The French called the area at the river's mouth ""Anse de la pêche"" or ""Fish Inlet"".

The Goulais River is a popular yellow pickerel fishing area. The river is also home to bass, brook trout, and other species.","user
